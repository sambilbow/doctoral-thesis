### Abstract
This research explores and resituates augmented reality (AR) as a creative medium for the development of interactive and expressive works by computational artists and musicians. The research is guided primarily by the research questions: ``What are AR's boundaries and affordances as a medium, are there problems it poses artists and musicians?”, and ``What is the resultant experience for participants of an artistic AR experience?”. To address these questions, the thesis outlines a three-year exploration into AR's use as a medium for multisensory musical performance and experience, and is further guided by the following aims:

- To plot the contextual history of AR, its contemporary forms, trends, exceptions, and definitions.
- To identify and develop key theoretical areas of artistic AR and its mode of engagement.
- To contribute theoretically and practically to the field of artistic and musical AR through a practice-based and open-research methodology.

The principal contributions of the thesis are threefold. From a comprehensive review the contextual history of AR, the author sets out to identify a position from which to develop an artistic AR practice (C2). From this position, perspectives on the nascent use of AR within the arts are offered through the the lenses of material, embodiment, and spatial theories (C3). Furthermore, the author shares their practice-based open-research method for creating iterating on and evaluating musical AR experiences, in the form of a set of repeatable design patterns and guidelines (C4). Finally, the author evaluates and analyses a set of three multisensory AR musical experiences that have been developed during the thesis, and that are available online (C5-7).
