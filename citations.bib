  abstract = {Ultrasonic mid-air tactile displays offer a unique combination of high spatial and temporal resolution and can stimulate a wide range of tactile frequencies. Leveraging those features, a new modulation technique producing spatially distributed tactile sensations has recently been introduced. This new approach, referred to as Spatiotemporal Modulation (STM), draws lines, curves and shapes on users' palm by moving a midair tactile point rapidly and repeatedly along the path. STM parameters and their impact on tactile perception are yet to be studied systematically. In this work, we first study how varying the draw frequency and the size of a simple shape affects the participants perception of texture and their emotional responses. In the second part of our study, we used the most salient tactile patterns of the first study to extend the results within a multimodal context. We found that tactile patterns' perception was consistent within both studies. We also found instances when the tactile patterns could alter the perception of the audio and visual stimuli. Finally, we discuss the benefits of our findings and conclude with implications for future work.},

This paper looks at the issue of tackling hate speech on social networks and argues that, notwithstanding the weaknesses of internal policies and their implementation, their existence, as facilitated by the Code of Conduct, serves as a light at the end of the Internet hate tunnel where issues of multiple jurisdictions as well as technological realities, such as mirror sites and more, have resulted in the task of online regulation being more than a daunting one.},

Contrary to how musical interfaces in VR are normally used, a performer using AVRL is not disconnected from their surrounding environment through immersion, nor is their body restrained by a head-mounted display. Rather, AVRL utilizes two VR sensors and the Unity game engine to map virtual musical sounds onto physical objects in the real world. These objects help the performer locate the sounds. Using two handheld VR controllers, these sounds can be triggered, looped, acoustically affected, or repositioned in space. AVRL thus combines the affordances of the physical world and a VR system with the reconfigurability of a game engine. This integration results in an expansive and augmented performance environment that facilitates full-body musical interactions.},

  abstract = {Until recently, social media was seen to promote democratic discourse on social and political issues. However, this powerful communication platform has come under scrutiny for allowing hostile actors to exploit online discussions in an attempt to manipulate public opinion. A case in point is the ongoing U.S. Congress investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, with Russia accused of, among other things, using trolls (malicious accounts created for the purpose of manipulation) and bots (automated accounts) to spread misinformation and politically biased information. In this study, we explore the effects of this manipulation campaign, taking a closer look at users who re-shared the posts produced on Twitter by the Russian troll accounts publicly disclosed by U.S. Congress investigation. We collected a dataset with over 43 million elections-related posts shared on Twitter between September 16 and November 9, 2016 by about 5.7 million distinct users. This dataset includes accounts associated with the identified Russian trolls. We use label propagation to infer the users' ideology based on the news sources they shared, to classify a large number of them as liberal or conservative with precision and recall above 90\%. Conservatives retweeted Russian trolls significantly more often than liberals and produced 36 times more tweets. Additionally, most of the troll content originated in, and was shared by users from Southern states. Using state-of-the-art bot detection techniques, we estimated that about 4.9\% and 6.2\% of liberal and conservative users respectively were bots. Text analysis on the content shared by trolls reveals that they had a mostly conservative, pro-Trump agenda. Although an ideologically broad swath of Twitter users were exposed to Russian trolls in the period leading up to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, it was mainly conservatives who helped amplify their message.},

  abstract = {Rapidly advancing AR technologies are in a unique position to directly mediate between the human brain and the physical world. Though this tight coupling presents tremendous opportunities for human augmentation, it also presents new risks due to potential adversaries, including AR applications or devices themselves, as well as bugs or accidents. In this paper, we begin exploring potential risks to the human brain from augmented reality. Our initial focus is on sensory and perceptual risks (e.g., accidentally or maliciously induced visual adaptations, motion-induced blindness, and photosensitive epilepsy), but similar risks may span both lower- and higher-level human brain functions, including cognition, memory, and decision-making. Though they have not yet manifested in practice in early-generation AR technologies, we believe that such risks are uniquely dangerous in AR due to the richness and depth with which it interacts with a user's experience of the physical world. We propose a framework, based in computer security threat modeling, to conceptually and experimentally evaluate such risks. The ultimate goal of our work is to aid AR technology developers, researchers, and neuroscientists to consider these issues before AR technologies are widely deployed and become targets for real adversaries. By considering and addressing these issues now, we can help ensure that future AR technologies can meet their full, positive potential.},

Much of it we ignore amidst our fast passage from place to place, its qualities may be too quiet or fleeting to pay heed to above the bustle of our own thoughts, or we may experience the sounds as an annoyance. Manoeuvring our listening to be excited by its features is not so easy.This paper presents new artistic research that probes the hidden artefacts of everyday soundscapes - the sounds and details which we ignore or fail to engage - and draws them into a new audible reality. The work focuses on the affordances of spatial information in a novel combination of art and technology: site-specific composition and the ways of listening established by Schaeffer and his successors are combined with the technology of beam-forming from high resolution (Eigenmike) Ambisonics recordings, Ambisonics sound-field synthesis and the deployment of a new prototype loudspeaker. Underlying the artistic and scientific research is the hypothesis that spatially distributed information offers new opportunities to explore, isolate and musically develop features of interest, and that composition should address the same degree of spatiality as the real landscape. The work is part of the 'Reconfiguring the Landscape' project investigating how 3-D electroacoustic composition and sound-art can incite a new awareness of outdoor sound environments.},

  abstract = {"TECHNOCRATS OF THE IMAGINATION traces the rise of collaborative art and technology labs in the U.S. from WWII to the present. Ryan Bishop and John Beck reveal the intertwined histories of the avant-garde art movement and the military-industrial complex, showing how radical pedagogical practices traveled from Germany's Bauhaus movement to the U.S. art world and interacted with government-funded military research and development in university laboratories. During the 1960s both media labs and studio labs leaned heavily on methods of interdisciplinary collaboration and the power of American modernity to model new modes of social organization. The book's chapters take up MIT's Center for Art, Science, and Technology, Bell Labs's E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology) Salon, and Los Angeles Museum of Art's Art + Technology Program. Their interconnected history illuminates how much of contemporary media culture and aesthetics depends on the historical relationship between military, corporate, and university actors. In light of revived interest in Black Mountain College and other 1960s art and technology labs, this book draws important connections between the contemporary art world and the militarized lab model of research that has dominated the sciences since the 1950s. The authors situate the rise of collaborative art and technology projects in the 1960s within John Dewey's ideology of scientific democracy, showing how leading thinkers from the Bauhaus movement in Germany immigrated to the U.S. and brought with them a Deweyan model for collaborative and interdisciplinary art and technology research. Over the course of the decade, the U.S. government increased funding to scientific research at university and private laboratories. Beck and Bishop investigate how various art and technology projects incorporated the collaborative and innovative interdisciplinarity of the avant-garde art movement with the corporate funding structure driven by the U.S. government's military and technoscientific interests. Finally, the authors consider the legacy of 1960s art and technology projects. During the 1970s and 80s, defense R\&D funding was less motivated by a Cold War corporate state, and was instead restructured according to an entrepreneurial and neoliberal model. At the same time, funding in the art world also became increasingly financialized and globalized. Today's art and technology work happens collaboratively not because of an intellectual commitment to interdisciplinarity, but because of the precarity of the contemporary labor market. This book will interest students and scholars in art history and theory, media studies, history of technology, American studies, cultural studies, and critical university studies"--},

The mobile nature of MAR applications limits users' interaction capabilities such as inputs, and haptic feedbacks. This survey reviews current research issues in the area of human computer interaction for MAR and haptic devices. The survey first presents human sensing capabilities and their applicability in AR applications. We classify haptic devices into two groups according to the triggered sense: cutaneous/tactile: touch, active surfaces, and mid-air; kinesthetic: manipulandum, grasp, and exoskeleton. Due to the mobile capabilities of MAR applications, we mainly focus our study on wearable haptic devices for each category and their AR possibilities. To conclude, we discuss the future paths that haptic feedbacks should follow for MAR applications and their challenges.},

In this paper, we combine the main constraints of musical performances and Virtual Reality applications into a set of dimensions, meant to extensively describe IVMIs stage setups. A number of existing stage setups are then classified using these dimensions, explaining how they were used to showcase live virtual performances and discussing their scenographic level.},

On the other hand, visual feedback on controllers remains limited and/or fixed, preventing similar personalizing. In this paper, we propose ControllAR, a novel system that facilitates the appropriation of rich visual feedback on control surfaces through remixing of graphical user interfaces and augmented reality display.

However, in the context of spontaneous and heterogeneous orchestras, such as jam sessions, collective music-making may become challenging due to the diversity and complexity of the DMIs and the musicians' unfamiliarity with the others' instruments. In particular, the potential lack of visibility into each musician's respective contribution to the sound they hear, i.e. who is playing what, might impede their capacity to play together. In this paper, we propose to augment each instrument in a digital orchestra with visual feedback extracted in real-time from the instrument's activity, in order to increase this awareness. We present the results of a user study in which we investigate the influence of visualisation level and situational visibility during short improvisations by groups of three musicians. Our results suggest that internal visualisations of all instruments displayed close to each musician's instrument provide the best awareness.},

I will use an iterative design process to create my own multi- sensory AR instruments, which will be used in an installation.

The findings would culminate in a thesis paper exploring the impact of augmented reality technology on user perception and expression, and the creation of a software tool that could be used as a research platform and framework for creating multi- sensory AR experiences that are immersive for both artist and audience.},

  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is increasingly being envisaged as a process of perceptual mediation or modulation, not only as a system that combines aligned and interactive virtual objects with a real environment. Within artistic practice, this reconceptualisation has led to a medium that emphasises this multisensory integration of virtual processes, leading to expressive, narrative-driven, and thought-provoking AR experiences. This paper outlines the development and evaluation of the polaris{\textasciitilde} experience. polaris{\textasciitilde} is built using a set of open-source hardware and software components that can be used to create privacy-respecting and cost-effective audiovisual AR experiences. Its wearable component is comprised of the open-source Project North Star AR headset and a pair of bone conduction headphones, providing simultaneous real and virtual visual and auditory elements. These elements are spatially aligned using Unity and PureData to the real space that they appear in and can be gesturally interacted with in a way that fosters artistic and musical expression. In order to evaluate the polaris{\textasciitilde}, 10 participants were recruited, who spent approximately 30 minutes each in the AR scene and were interviewed about their experience. Using grounded theory, the author extracted coded remarks from the transcriptions of these studies, that were then sorted into the categories of Sentiment, Learning, Adoption, Expression, and Immersion. In evaluating polaris{\textasciitilde} it was found that the experience engaged participants fruitfully, with many noting their ability to express themselves audiovisually in creative ways. The experience and the framework the author used to create it is available in a Github respository.},

  abstract = {It has been thirty years since the original definition of augmented reality (AR) as a technology used to `augment the visual field of a user with information necessary in the performance of tasks'. In this first instance, it was developed with the purpose to `improve the efficiency and quality of human workers in their performance of manufacturing activities' (Caudell and Mizell, 1992). Alongside subsequent decades of funding from the U.S. military-industrial complex (MIC), we have also seen the uptake and reappropriation of AR in creative fields, such as computational art, performance, design, and entertainment - these works often proposing do-it-yourself (DIY) and open-source approaches to their design. Despite these developments, AR within sound-driven forms of art have been relatively under-explored. If an AR system can be thought of as one that can combine real and virtual multisensory processes, is interactive in real-time, and is registered in three dimensions (Azuma, 1997); why do we, thirty years on, witness the paradigmatic form of AR still being heavily biased (Billinghurst et al., 2015) towards it being a method of visual information overlay? Standing in stark contrast to the currently unfolding and hyper-commercialised view of AR {\textendash} as defined by the corporate `Metaverse' {\textendash} this thesis resituates AR as an artistic medium for the creation of interactive and expressive works by musicians and sound artists. It is guided primarily by the questions: `What are AR's affordances as an artistic medium, what is the resultant experience for participants and audiences (or `immersants') in these experiences, and what might a future of AR digital music instruments look, sound, and feel like?' To address these questions, this practice-based research takes a DIY Approach to Sound ARt, arguing that, as an mediumthat combines real and virtual multisensory processes, it must explored with a sensory-process agnostic approach {\textendash} that is, to approach AR as more than mere visual-information overlay, instead as `real-time computationally mediated perception' (Chevalier and Kiefer, 2020). This has involved making and hacking technology as a necessary aesthetic and political stance against commercial AR technologies in their typical form. Three sound augmented reality art (ARt) experiences are outlined, and embody the majority of the practical contribution of this thesis: area{\textasciitilde}, polaris{\textasciitilde}, and polygons{\textasciitilde}. In discussing the results of these three study chapters, theoretical propositions are made: `augmented materiality', `augmented embodiment', and `augmented space', that have implications for the use of AR as a sonic medium. Moreover, out of the iterated design of the AR experiences, their study, evaluation, and discussion, three `design guidelines' for those in the field interested in reproducing or developing similar sound ARt have been developed: Designing for Rich AR Experience, Consideration of the AR Instrument, and Role of the Virtual in the AR Environment.},

The project is motivated by the authors' own experience of working with interactive technologies in the context of dance. This experience has led to the desire to more closely relate the sensing capabilities of an interactive system to a dancer's own body awareness which prominently involve aspects of inner perception. The outcome of this project demonstrates that such an approach can help to establish interactive musical scenarios for dance that are not only more intuitive to work with for dancers but that also offer new possibilities for composers to tap into aspects of the dancers' expressivity that are normally hidden for an audience.},

Our ``In Situ Audio Services'' (ISAS) application responds to these needs, allowing users to explore an urban area without necessarily having a particular destination in mind. We describe the technical aspects of its implementation, user requirements, interface design, safety concerns, POI data source issues, and further requirements to make the system practical on a wider basis.

Our illusion relies on the properties of certain scents, such as the coolness of mint or hotness of peppers. These odors trigger not only the olfactory bulb, but also the nose's trigeminal nerve, which has receptors that respond to both temperature and chemicals. To exploit this, we engineered a wearable device based on micropumps and an atomizer that emits up to three custom-made ``thermal'' scents directly to the user's nose. Breathing in these scents causes the user to feel warmer or cooler. We demonstrate how our device renders warmth and cooling sensations in virtual experiences. Participants rated VR experiences with our trigeminal stimulants as significantly warmer or cooler than the baseline conditions. Lastly, we believe this offers an alternative to thermal feedback devices, which unfortunately rely on power-hungry heat-lamps or Peltier-elements.},

  abstract = {Traditional Western musical instruments have evolved to be robust and predictable, responding consistently to the same player actions with the same musical response. Consequently, errors occurring in a performance scenario are typically attributed to the performer and thus a hallmark of musical accomplishment is a flawless musical rendition. Digital musical instruments often increase the potential for a second type of error as a result of technological failure within one or more components of the instrument. Gestural instruments using machine learning can be particularly susceptible to these types of error as recognition accuracy often falls short of 100\%, making errors a familiar feature of gestural music performances. In this paper we refer to these technology-related errors as system errors, which can be difficult for players and audiences to disambiguate from performer errors. We conduct a pilot study in which participants repeat a note selection task in the presence of simulated system errors. The results suggest that, for the gestural music system under study, controlled increases in system error correspond to an increase in the occurrence and severity of performer error. Furthermore, we find the system errors reduce a performer's sense of control and result in the instrument being perceived as less accurate and less responsive.},

  abstract = {The democratization of Computer Arts and Computer Music has, due to dematerialization (virtualization) consequence of digital technologies, considerably widened the boundaries of creativity. As we are now entering a second phase that has been labeled ``post-digital'', we are called to reconcile this openness with notions such as embodiment, presence, enaction and tangibility. These notions are in our view inherently linked to creativity. Here we outline some approaches to this problem under development within the ``European Art-ScienceTechnology Network'' (EASTN1). Several areas of artistic creation are represented (Music, Animation, Multisensory Arts, Architecture, Fine Arts, Graphic communication, etc.). A main objective of this network is to establish common grounds through collaborative reflection and work on the above notions, using the concept of tangibility as a focal point. In this paper we describe several different approaches to the tangibility, in relation to concepts such as reality, materiality, objectivity, presence, concreteness, etc. and their antonyms. Our objective is to open a debate on tangibility, in the belief that it has a strong unifying potential but is also at the same time presents challenging and difficult to define. Here we present some initial thoughts on this topic in a first effort to bring together the approaches that arise from the different practices and projects developed within the partner institutions involved in the EASTN network.},

This method is a first step in the design of an analysis tool for gesture-sound relationships. In this exploration we used motion capture data recorded from subjects performing free hand movements while listening to short sound examples. We assume that even though the relationship between gesture and sound might be more complex, at least part of it can be revealed and quantified by linear multivariate regression applied to the motion capture data and audio descriptors extracted from the sound examples. After outlining the theoretical background, the article shows how the method allows for pertinent reasoning about the relationship between gesture and sound by analysing the data sets recorded from multiple and individual subjects.},

Smartwatches are gaining popularity, yet little is known about the user experience and their impact on our increasingly always online culture. We report on a qualitative study with existing users on their everyday use of smartwatches to understand both the added value and the challenges of being constantly connected at the wrist. Our findings show that users see a large benefit in receiving notifications on their wrist, especially in terms of helping manage expectations of availability. Moreover, we find that response rates after viewing a notification on a smartwatch change based on the other devices available: laptops prompt quicker replies than smartphones. Finally, there are still many costs associated with using smartwatches, thus we make a series of design recommendations to improve the user experience of smartwatches.},

  abstract = {"A leading philosopher takes a mind-bending journey through virtual worlds, illuminating the nature of reality and our place within it. Virtual reality is genuine reality. That's the central thesis of Reality+. In a highly original work of "technophilosophy," David J. Chalmers argues that virtual worlds generated by computers are not second-class worlds. We can live a meaningful life in virtual reality. We may even be living in a computer simulation already-and if we are, that's not so bad. What is reality, anyway? How do we know there's an external world? What's the relation between mind and body? How can we lead a good life? Is there a god? In Reality+, Chalmers conducts a grand tour of philosophy, using virtual worlds to illuminate all of these questions and to provide new answers to many of them. Studded with illustrations that bring philosophical issues to life, Reality+ is a major statement that will shape discussion of philosophy and technology for years to come"--},

As an artist-led project the concerns of the artist were paramount, and this article presents Shift-Life as part of an on-going exploration into the parallels between the non-linear human thinking process and computation using semantic association to link items into ideas, and ideas into holistic concepts. Our art explores perceptions and states of mind as we move our attention between the simulated world of the computer and the real-world we inhabit, which means that any viewer engagement is participatory rather than passive. From a Mixed Reality point of view, the lead author intends to explore the convergence of the physical and virtual, therefore the formalization of the Mixed Reality system, focusing on the integration of artificial life, ecology, physical sensors and participant interaction through an interface of physical props. It is common for digital media artists to allow viewers to activate a work either through a computer screen via direct keyboard or mouse manipulation, or through immersive means to activate their work, for ``Shift-Life'' the artist was concerned with a direct ``relational'' approach where viewers would intuitively engage with the installation's everyday objects, and with each other, to fully experience the piece. The Mixed Reality system is mediated via physical environmental sensors, which affect the virtual environment and autonomous agents, which in turn reacts and is expressed as virtual pixels projected onto a physical surface. The tangible hands-on interface proved to be instinctive, attractive and informative on many levels, delivering a good example of collaboration between the Arts and Science.},

We are exploring the alignability of binaural signals with artificially spatialized sources, synthesized by convolving monaural signals with left/right pairs of directional transfer functions. We use MAW (multidimensional audio windows), a NeXT-based system, as a binaural directional mixing console. Since the rearrangement of a dynamic map is used to dynamically select transfer functions, a user may specify the virtual location of a sound source, throwing the source into perceptual space, using exocentric graphical control to drive egocentric auditory display. As a concept demonstration, we muted a telephone, and then used MAW to spatialize a ringing signal at its location, putting the sonic image of the phone into the office environment. By juxtaposing and mixing 'real' and 'synthetic' audio transmissions, we are exploring the relationship between acoustic telepresence and VR presentations: telepresence manifests as the actual configuration of sources in a sound field, as perceivable by a dummyhead; VR is the perception yielded by filtering of virtual sources with respect to virtual sinks. We have conducted an experiment testing the usefulness of such a hybrid.{$<>$}},

To support the design of future systems, designers need an understanding of spatial design decisions that impact audio practitioners' processes and communication. This chapter proposes a typology of VR interactive audio systems, focusing on their function and the role of space in their design. Spatial categories are proposed to be able to analyse the role of space within existing interactive audio VR products. Based on the spatial design considerations explored in this chapter, a series of implications for design are offered that future research can exploit.},

With most of the research and development focused on delivering the promise of MR, there is only barely a few working on the privacy and security implications of this technology. This survey paper aims to put in to light these risks, and to look into the latest security and privacy work on MR. Specifically, we list and review the different protection approaches that have been proposed to ensure user and data security and privacy in MR. We extend the scope to include work on related technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and human-computer interaction (HCI) as crucial components, if not the origins, of MR, as well as numerous related work from the larger area of mobile devices, wearables, and Internet-of-Things (IoT). We highlight the lack of investigation, implementation, and evaluation of data protection approaches in MR. Further challenges and directions on MR security and privacy are also discussed.},

Non-employed, along with the students, are finding it difficult to find stable employment since this pandemic brought many setbacks to employed and more particularly to unemployed students. This study explores the lived experiences, challenges, and coping mechanisms of Axie Infinity Players amidst the pandemic. The study employed the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis with 20 participants. The following conclusions were drawn based on the study's findings: (1 )For the most part, playing Axie Infinity is not as easy as it looks. (2) Most of the Axie Infinity players are students and it takes a lot of their time playing Axie Infinity that most of their time is spent playing instead of resting and studying just to reach their quota for that day. (3)Axie Infinity is both a blessing and stress. The Axie Infinity play-to-earn game is described as a blessing because it became the number one source of income of the participants despite being amid this pandemic. It also became their source of stress because it adds pressure, tension, and strain to their lives as both a player and a student. (4) Axie Infinity players need a strong support system in their psychological, spiritual, emotional, and physical aspects to withstand the situation of lacking sleep and rest, the pressure of the need to reach the quota, slow internet connection, judgments of the people that surround them, and not being able to focus in both playing and studying. (5) Finally, Axie Infinity players value themselves by coping with negative experiences and challenges they have been through.},

In this paper, we profile the risks and benefits of PTE gaming, with a specific focus on AI. Qualitative data in the form of online chat threads was evaluated via a Thematic Analysis (TA) approach. The analysis revealed a number of themes including the dominance of extrinsically motivated gameplay in conjunction with negative appraisals of game quality, the benefits and costs of play, and the potential for PTE scholarship models to be associated with exploitation. The results did, however, indicate awareness of potential consumer risks. The findings have implications for informing consumer education, regulation, as well as areas of focus in future quantitative research.},

Arts are quantified in expectations of extending forms of communication with people and our environments, by creating humanistic ways of interfacing with machines. Within the experience economy the term `immersion' is overused trending towards VR, which has troubled many researchers and practitioners across disciplines. Drawing on perspectives from performance studies, digital humanities, and human-computer interaction (HCI), this paper reviews the role of XR-enabling technologies, beyond VR, in designing immersive experiences, and their integration into performance practices. It discusses the shift of the artist's role in imagineering new resources and new ways of working to immerse audiences, and it evaluates this in a postdigital context. It discusses how immersion operates, and critiques components necessary to create affective environments in terms of audience engagement, agency, participation, involvement, presence, embodiment and interaction. The article discusses how performance as a lab can act as a method of inquiry by bringing the anthropological, performative and theatrical perspectives; and the ethics of to testing immersive-enabling technologies and/or experiences within the context of live performances.},

In this study, we investigate the privacy perspectives of individuals when they are bystanders around AR devices. We conducted 12 field sessions in caf{\'e}s and interviewed 31 bystanders regarding their reactions to a co-located AR device. Participants were predominantly split between having indifferent and negative reactions to the device. Participants who expressed that AR devices change the bystander experience attributed this difference to subtleness, ease of recording, and the technology's lack of prevalence. Additionally, participants surfaced a variety of factors that make recording more or less acceptable, including what they are doing when the recording is being taken. Participants expressed interest in being asked permission before being recorded and in recording-blocking devices. We use the interview results to guide an exploration of design directions for privacymediating technologies.},

In an effort to continue the development of methodological best practices, we need to acknowledge with more nuance the tensions that arise in use. In this paper, we articulate such tensions by examining two first-hand accounts of using autobiographical design and four autobiographical design projects of other HCI researchers. Our findings address: genuine needs, design participation, intimacy, reflexivity, and authorial voice. Our contribution is constituted of critical insights into the complexities of using autobiographical design and recommendations for researchers interested in using this method.},

A total of 291 papers with 369 individual user studies have been reviewed and classified based on their application areas. The primary contribution of the review is to present the broad landscape of user-based AR research, and to provide a high-level view of how that landscape has changed. We summarize the high-level contributions from each category of papers, and present examples of the most influential user studies. We also identify areas where there have been few user studies, and opportunities for future research. Among other things, we find that there is a growing trend toward handheld AR user studies, and that most studies are conducted in laboratory settings and do not involve pilot testing. This research will be useful for AR researchers who want to follow best practices in designing their own AR user studies.},

It starts with a discussion of the paradigm of `interaction' in existing computer music and live electronics approaches, and develops following bio-cybernetic principles such as `system/ambience coupling', `noise', and `self-organisation'. Central to the paper is an understanding of `interaction' as a network of interdependencies among system components, and as a means for dynamical behaviour to emerge upon the contact of an autonomous system (e.g. a DSP unit) with the external environment (room or else hosting the performance). The author describes the design philosophy in his current work with the AESI (whose DSP component was implemented as a signal patch in K               YMA               5.2), touching on compositional implications (not only live electronics situations, but also sound installations).},

Issues relating to human{\textendash} computer interaction (HCI) are as important to interactive art making as issues relating to the colours of paint are to painting. It is not that HCI and art necessarily share goals. It is just that much of the knowledge of HCI and its methods can contribute to interactive art making. This paper reviews recent work that looks at these issues in the art context. In interactive digital art, the artist is concerned with how the artwork behaves, how the audience interacts with it and, ultimately, in participant experience and their degree of engagement. The paper looks at these issues and brings together a collection of research results and art practice experiences that together help to illuminate this significant new and expanding area. In particular, it is suggested that this work points towards a much needed critical language that can be used to describe, compare and discuss interactive digital art.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the utruchirp software, a tool for measuring impulse responses and modelling room acoustics in real time through auralisation based on convolution using those responses. utruchirp is the result of concerns and needs emerging from the authors' ongoing artistic practice, exploring room scale acoustic feedback as material for live performance, installations, and fixed media pieces as utrumque.The paper provides the technical and, more importantly, the artistic details of the development of utruchirp and its features, highlighting those that are the direct result of insights from artistic work: Monitoring of all stages of measuring and signal processing, auralisations of the measurements from within the measurement process, and integrated round trip delay estimation. Finally, it points out future directions and features that are to be explored next, with an invitation for collaborative efforts, aiming to bring the sensibilities of musical instruments to our measurement tools.},

  abstract = {This paper describes two site-specific musical compositions, focusing on how modelling was used in their respective composition processes. Primarily, the acoustics of the sites were modelled to aid in the preparation and composition of the pieces. From this we propose the general use of modelling as a way to work with the concept of site. But the idea of formulating a model is also applicable more widely in the work described and this is discussed with the two pieces as starting points.Both pieces use acoustic room scale feedback as their only source of sound, so the impact of the room, speakers and microphones used is immense. The first piece, Rundg{\aa}ng, is a commission for the GRM Acousmonium. The second piece, Clockwork, is a public installation that will also be the site of a performance, combining the installation with live interventions. Clockwork will also employ modelling as a component of the piece itself, and include a remote performer and a remote audience. We suggest that there are possibilities to employ compositional strategies to embrace these kinds of hybrid presence situations by composing for many vantage points.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to examine how sound in general (and electroacoustic music in particular) can evoke a sense of being and place which may be strongly related to our visual experience. The auditory system has evolved to seek the reasons for the soundfield it encounters and this property cannot meaningfully be ignored by composers in this medium. The acousmatic condition stimulates and enhances this response. The science of acoustics cannot any longer alone explain sound phenomena and requires psychological and ecological dimensions. The idea of the `frame' is developed from large-scale to small-scale soundfields: `landscape', `arena' and `stage' are seen to be flexible components of this approach to composition. The paper concludes that a mature relationship of audio and visual art forms requires a greater acknowledgement of these attributes of sound.},

The main insight for the proposed approach is the importance and utility of familiar sensorimotor experiences for the creation of engaging and playable new musical instruments. In particular, we suggest exploiting the commonalities between different natural interactions by varying the auditory response or tactile details of the instrument within certain limits. Using this principle, devices for classes of sounds such as coarse grain collision interactions or friction interactions can be designed. The designs we propose retain the familiar tactile aspect of the interaction so that the performer can take advantage of tacit knowledge gained through experiences with such phenomena in the real world.},

This paper reports on undergraduate perceptions of assessment and feedback in the Department of Geography at King's College London, UK. Twenty-eight first and second-year students across six focus groups provided comments on their understanding of feedback, their feedback experiences, and what they felt could be improved. It was clear that students desired feedback that would help them improve summative performance, but were unsure of how best to use it and consequently had high expectations that led to dissatisfaction. Particular concern was expressed about marking and feedback consistency, and the inherent variation in practice they experienced. Many comments indicated a lack of student agency, which may reflect the power relations that students find themselves in within their community of practice. Finding ways of fostering agency and improving dialogue over perceptions and expectations are suggested to be important steps in improving assessment and feedback practice, and student satisfaction.},

  abstract = {Enactivist Interventions' is an interdisciplinary work that explores how theories of embodied cognition illuminate many aspects of the mind, including intentionality, representation, the affect, perception, action and free will, higher-order cognition, and intersubjectivity. Gallagher argues for a rethinking of the concept of mind, drawing on pragmatism, phenomenology and cognitive science. Enactivism is presented as a philosophy of nature that has significant methodological and theoretical implications for the scientific investigation of the mind. Gallagher argues that, like the basic phenomena of perception and action, sophisticated cognitive phenomena like reflection, imagining, and mathematical reasoning are best explained in terms of an affordance-based skilled coping. He offers an account of the continuity that runs between basic action, affectivity, and a rationality that in every case remains embodied. Gallagher's analysis also addresses recent predictive models of brain function and outlines an alternative, enactivist interpretation that emphasizes the close coupling of brain, body and environment rather than a strong boundary that isolates the brain in its internal processes. The extensive relational dynamics that integrates the brain with the extra-neural body opens into an environment that is physical, social and cultural and that recycles back into the enactive process. Cognitive processes are in-the-world rather than in-the-head; they are situated in affordance spaces defined across evolutionary, developmental and individual histories, and are constrained by affective processes and normative dimensions of social and cultural practices--},

  abstract = {Supply chains enable the flow of goods and services within economic systems. When mapped for the entire economy and geographic locations of a country, supply chains form a spatial web of interactions among suppliers and buyers. One way to characterize supply chains is through multiregional input-output linkages. Using a multiregional input-output dataset, we build the multilayer network of supply chains in the United States. Together with a network cascade model, the multilayer network is used to explore the propagation of economic shocks along intranational supply chains. We find that the effect of economic shocks, measured using the avalanche size or total number of collapsed nodes, varies widely depending on the geographic location and economic sector of origin of a shock. The response of the supply chains to shocks reveals a threshold-like behavior. Below a certain failure or fragility level, the avalanche size increases relatively quickly for any node in the network. Based on this result, we find that the most fragile regions tend to be located in the central United States, which are regions that tend to specialize in food production and manufacturing. The most fragile layers are chemical and pharmaceutical products, services and food-related products, which are all sectors that have been disrupted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States. The fragility risk, measured by the intersection of the fragility level of a node and its exposure to shocks, varies across regions and sectors. This suggests that interventions aiming to make the supply-chain network more robust to shocks are likely needed at multiple levels of network aggregation.},

This demonstrates how an acoustic metamaterial prism, in combination with an electronic composer, may be used to deliver different sound messages to different parts of an audience, even with a single speaker.

This article lends support to this argument by developing an ecosystemically situated account of our relationships with technology and processes of skill formation. It is argued that this sense of continuity is justified, but that where differences of experiences do arise these are not, as sometimes supposed, an essential characteristic of digital technologies. On the basis that much of our skill formation consists of tacit knowledge, it is suggested that further discussion on how particular circumstances and skills arise would be revealing. Two possible headings for such discussion are suggested in the form of `Agility' and `Playfulness'.},

  abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) audio refers to techniques where virtual sounds are superimposed with real sounds to produce immersive digital content. Headphones are widely used in consumer devices for playback of virtual sounds. However, for AR audio, an important step is to make sure that headphones allow external sounds to pass through naturally. To achieve this, a technique called Hear-Through (HT) processing is commonly employed to reproduce the incoming real sound by playing back processed version of it. In this context, open-back and headphones and closed in-ear headphones have been employed for HT processing. Closed-back headphones provide strong isolation unlike open-back headphones and do not have fittings issue as well as modified ear canal resonance effect found in closed in-ear headphones. In this paper, an investigation of HT design using closed-back circumaural headphones equipped with two pairs of microphones was conducted. An adaptive filtering algorithm was used to derive the ideal equalization filter. To alleviate the direction dependency of the ideal equalization filter and simplify HT filter design, two simplified equalization filters were also introduced. Experiments with objective evaluation using spectral difference and subjective evaluation on both timbre and spatial performance were conducted. These experimental results indicate a close match of the ideal equalized signal with the reference signal in open ear listening, which is slightly degraded in the simplified equalization filters, but outperforms the default ambient hear-through mode in the commercial headphones.},

This is achieved by substituting the force felt at the fingertips when grip an object with an audio feedback displayed through the earphones of a mobile phone. The patient wears a glove integrated with pressure sensors mounted on the fingertips, and the sensors' pressure signals are conditioned and wirelessly transmitted to a mobile phone interface to display an audio with a volume linearly proportional to the pressure applied by the fingers of patients.},

  abstract = {This article analyses the British dance music industry and assesses claims that it offers a powerful alternative to the 'mainstream' music business. Two unusual features of the sector are identified. Whereas the recording industry as a whole is marked by concentration and centralization, the UK dance music industry is relatively decentralized and is made up of large numbers of 'independent' companies. Reasons for the success of small, local companies are offered, in particular the emphasis amongst dance audiences on genre, rather than on performer identity; and the low promotional costs enabled by negative press coverage of 'acid house' in the late 1980s. But the article argues that a number of features of the British dance music industry work against a view of the sector as a radical challenge to prevailing cultural-industry practices. These are as follows: firstly, the reliance of dance music companies on crossover hits and compilation albums; secondly, close ties between the independents and corporate partners; and thirdly, the pressures placed upon small companies to follow the standard ways of dealing with risk in the recording industry- in particular, the development of a star system.},

This article deems the object-centric approach both philosophically and theoretically problematic and builds up to an alternative, ``action-predicated'' approach, whose aim is to simulate virtual experiences with a primary emphasis on pragmatic functionality instead. Section 1 lays out the rationale of the article and provides an outline for its general structure. Section 2 illustrates the nature of the problem being tackled and articulates a philosophically motivated critique, demonstrating the necessary limitations of the standard approach, as well as the need for an alternative. Section 3 draws on the enactive approach to cognitive science and begins the formulation of such an alternative. Section 4 completes the turn toward an action-predicated approach and argues, in particular, for a flow-based conception of immersive VR experience. Section 5 systematically discusses the methodological implications of the theoretical merits of this article by examining a design probe, Wake, conducted on participants (N = 25) in a mixed reality (MR) setting.

  abstract = {Why is there so much more research on vision than on any other sensory modality? There is a seemingly easy answer to this question: It is because vision is our most important and most complex sense. Although there are arguments in favor of this explanation, it can be challenged in two ways: by showing that the arguments regarding the importance and complexity of vision are debatable and by demonstrating that there are other aspects that need to be taken into account. Here, I argue that the explanation is debatable, as there are various ways of defining ``importance'' and ``complexity'' and, as there is no clear consensus that vision is indeed the most important and most complex of our senses. Hence, I propose two additional explanations: According to the methodological-structural explanation, there is more research on vision because the available, present-day technology is better suited for studying vision than for studying other modalities {\textendash} an advantage which most likely is the result of an initial bias toward vision, which reinforces itself. Possible reasons for such an initial bias are discussed. The cultural explanation emphasizes that the dominance of the visual is not an unchangeable constant, but rather the result of the way our societies are designed and thus heavily influenced by human decision-making. As it turns out, there is no universal hierarchy of the senses, but great historical and cross-cultural variation. Realizing that the dominance of the visual is socially and culturally reinforced and not simply a law of nature, gives us the opportunity to take a step back and to think about the kind of sensory environments we want to create and about the kinds of theories that need to be developed in research.},

The results of this study form the basis for the development of an ``intelligent'' noise protection headphone as part of Cyber Physical Production Systems, which provides auditorily augmented information to machine operators and enables radio communication between them. Further application areas are implementations in control rooms (equipped with multichannel loudspeaker systems) and utilization for training purposes. The focus of our research lies on situation-specific acoustic processing of conditioned machine sounds and operation related data with high information content, considering the often highly auditorily influenced working knowledge of skilled workers. As a proof-of-concept the data stream of error probability estimations regarding partly manipulated 3D printing processes was mapped to three sonification models, giving evidence about momentary operation states. The neural network applied indicates a high accuracy ({$>$}93\%) concerning error estimation distinguishing between normal and manipulated operation states. None of the manipulated states could be identified by listening. An auditory augmentation, respectively sonification of these error estimations provides a considerable benefit to process monitoring.},

This creative potential has been extended by way of modern sensing and computing technology which allows the position of the listener to act as an input to interactive musical works in immersive, digital environments. Furthermore, the sophistication of sensing technology has reached a point where barriers to implementing these digital interactive musical systems in the physical world are dissolving.In this research we have set out to understand what new modes of artistic performance might be enabled by these interactive spatial musical systems, and what the analysis of these systems can tell us about the compositional principles of arranging musical elements in space as well as time.We have applied a practice-based approach, leveraging processes of software development, composition, and performance to create a complete system for composing and performing what we refer to as spatial metacompositions. The system is tested at scale in the realisation of a musical work based upon the path of a sailplane in flight.Analysis of the work and the supporting system leads us to suggest opportunities exist for extending existing intermodal composition theory through the analysis of audiovisual renderings of performed spatial works. We also point to unique challenges posed by spatial arrangement, such as effective strategies for structuring musical notes in three dimensions as to produce strong harmonic movement.Beyond enabling new modes of artistic expression, the understanding garnered from these musical structures may help inform a more generalisable approach to non-linear composition, leveraging virtual representations of musical space that respond to arbitrary input data.},

New visual affordances present in VR give designers new methods for augmenting instruments to extend not only their expressivity, but also their capabilities for computer assisted tutoring. In this work, we present VRMin, a mobile Mixed Reality (MR) application for augmenting a physical theremin, with an immersive virtual environment (VE), for real time computer assisted tutoring. We augment a physical theremin with 3D visual cues to indicate correct hand positioning for performing given notes and volumes. The physical theremin acts as a domain specific controller for the resulting MR environment. The initial effectiveness of this approach is measured by analyzing a performer's hand position while training with and without the VRMin. We also evaluate the usability of the interface using heuristic evaluation based on a newly proposed set of guidelines designed for VR musical environments.},

The objective of this paper is to conceptualize what we mean by form in the context of interaction design and HCI research and how we can approach it in regard to emerging type of digital materiality. To do this, we first examine conceptual dimensions of form in interactive artifacts through the lens of three existing perspectives with their respective focus on: material, meaning, and making. We then apply these perspectives in our analysis of specific forms of interactive artifacts. Based on this analysis, we suggest a model of four different types of forms: the cognitive, embodied, expressive, and exploratory forms. Reflecting on this model, we propose form-driven interaction design research with its epistemological and methodological implications.},

The purpose of this paper is to foster understanding of spatial audio through examples of practical problems. These problems reveal some general misconceptions about spatial hearing that explain why things go wrong. A particular lesson to be gleaned from this discussion is that there is no silver bullet for solving spatial audio problems, and every situation needs to be understood in its proper context.},

The present study investigates how music or an ambient soundscape influence presence, the feeling of "being there", as well as positive and negative affect. Fifty-one subjects participated, taking a stroll through a virtual park presented via a head-mounted display while they were walking on a treadmill. Sound was varied within subjects in four audio conditions: In a randomized sequence, participants experienced silence, a nature soundscape and music of positive or negative valence. In addition, time of day (daytime vs. nighttime walk) in the virtual environment was varied between subjects. Afterwards they were asked to rate their experience of presence and the positive and negative affect experienced. Results indicated that replaying any kind of sound lead to higher presence ratings compared to no sound at all, but there was no difference between playing a soundscape or music. Background music, however, tended to induce the expected emotions, though somewhat dependent on the musical pieces chosen. Further studies might evaluate whether it is possible to induce emotions through positive or negative (non-musical) soundscapes as well.},

This can be seen in Vocktail and Season Traveller, two digital devices incorporating taste and smell. Vocktail is an AR technology that augments the experience of drinking water, or even air, through the electrical stimulation of tastebuds and the manipulation of color and smell. Season Traveller is a VR game in which the user moves through four seasonal landscapes. It uses wind, odor, and temperature in addition to the more standard audio-visual displays. The cultural dimensions of these devices can be examined using phenomenological terms. They instigate perceptual circuits, and call on and create sedimented habits. Although VR and AR are often thought of in terms of their similitude to reality, understanding Vocktail and Season Traveller this way illustrates the world-creating dimension of multisensory devices. These technologies structure and shift thresholds of taste and smell, reworking past perceptual styles and habits to develop new perceptual experiences. In so doing, Season Traveller and Vocktail throw to the fore questions about the conditions according to which people exercise their senses in digitally dominated environments.},

Listening Mirrors is designed to incorporate physical objects and computational systems for altering the acoustic environment, to enhance collective listening and challenge traditional musician-instrument performance. At a formative stage in exploring audio AR technology, we conducted an audience experience study investigating questions around the potential of audio AR in creating sound installation environments for collective musical expression. We collected interview evidence about the participants' experience and analysed the data with using a grounded theory approach. The results demonstrated that the technology has the potential to create immersive spaces where an audience can feel safe to experiment musically, and showed how AR can intervene in sound perception to instrumentalise an environment. The results also revealed caveats about the use of audio AR, mainly centred on social inhibition and seamlessness of experience, and finding a balance between mediated worlds to create space for interplay between the two.},

  abstract = {Conceptors are a recent development in the field of reservoir computing; they can be used to influence the dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), enabling generation of arbitrary patterns based on training data. Conceptors allow interpolation and extrapolation between patterns, and also provide a system of boolean logic for combining patterns together. Generation and manipulation of arbitrary patterns using conceptors has significant potential as a sound synthesis method for applications in computer music but has yet to be explored. Conceptors are untested with the generation of multi-timbre audio patterns, and little testing has been done on scalability to longer patterns required for audio. A novel method of sound synthesis based on conceptors is introduced. Conceptular Synthesis is based on granular synthesis; sets of conceptors are trained to recall varying patterns from a single RNN, then a runtime mechanism switches between them, generating short patterns which are recombined into a longer sound. The quality of sound resynthesis using this technique is experimentally evaluated. Conceptor models are shown to resynthesise audio with a comparable quality to a close equivalent technique using echo state networks with stored patterns and output feedback. Conceptor models are also shown to excel in their malleability and potential for creative sound manipulation, in comparison to echo state network models which tend to fail when the same manipulations are applied. Examples are given demonstrating creative sonic possibilities, by exploiting conceptor pattern morphing, boolean conceptor logic and manipulation of RNN dynamics.},

  abstract = {Feedback instruments offer radical new ways of engaging with instrument design and musicianship. They are defined by recurrent circulation of signals through the instrument, which give the instrument `a life of its own' and a 'stimulating uncontrollability'. Arguably, the most interesting musical behaviour in these instruments happens when their dynamic complexity is maximised, without falling into saturating feedback. It is often challenging to keep the instrument in this zone; this research looks at algorithmic ways to manage the behaviour of feedback loops in order to make feedback instruments more playable and musical; to expand the `sweet spot'. We propose a solution that manages gain dynamics based on measurement of complexity, using a realtime implementation of the Effort to Compress algorithm. The system was evaluated with four musicians, all who have different variations of string-based feedback instruments, following an autobiographical design approach. Qualitative feedback was gathered, showing that the system was successful in modifying the behaviour of these instruments to allow easier access to edge transition zones, sometimes at the expense of losing some of the more compelling dynamics of the instruments. Basic efficacy of the system is evidenced by descriptive audio analysis. This paper is accompanied by a dataset of sounds collected during the study, and open source software that was written to support the research.},

Even friends of the extended mind theory have argued that when it comes to the material substrate of conscious experience, the boundary of skin and skull is likely to prove somehow to be privileged. Such arguments have, however, typically conceived of the constitution of consciousness in synchronic terms, making a firm separation between proximate mechanisms and their ultimate causes. We argue that the processes involved in the constitution of some conscious experiences are diachronic, not synchronic. We focus on what we call phenomenal attunement in this paper{\textemdash}the feeling of being at home in a familiar, culturally constructed environment. Such a feeling is missing in cases of culture shock. Phenomenal attunement is a structure of our conscious experience of the world that is ubiquitous and taken for granted. We will argue that it is constituted by cycles of embodied and world-involving engagement whose dynamics are constrained by cultural practices. Thus, it follows that an essential structure of the conscious mind, the absence of which profoundly transforms conscious experience, is extended.},

  abstract = {Building on a long history of the integration of new technology into the arts, in this research we set out to develop and evaluate new methods for creating immersive, audio-centric artworks in a Mixed Reality (MR) context. We employ multiple levels of spatial audio, both within the room as well as the umbrellas that participants navigate the space with, in order to provide a 6 degree of freedom immersive experience. Furthermore, we use dynamic projection mapping, again both throughout the global environment, and on the umbrellas, to create immersive experiences. This allows the umbrellas to function as so-called Augmented Objects that facilitate the composition and navigation of Responsive Sonic Environments, thus encouraging participants to examine their own perceptions of reality while incorporating them into the larger artistic installation. Additionally, we explore the creation of Spatial Metacompositions, navigable environments that function as performance spaces for the participants who interact with them. Finally, we present the technical foundations necessary to create such systems and discuss techniques to effectively employ them in one's artistic practice.},

AR applications have traditionally focused upon paradigms that are visually led. In this paper, we document an Audio Augmented Reality (AAR) project, which considers soundscapes and how they might be transformed via the application of music and sound technologies. This work is concerned with the augmentation of nature soundscapes and explores how this may be used to enhance public understanding of the natural world. At present, we are concerned with the augmentation of spaces with biophony. Two examples of acoustic augmented reality are described: an initial pilot study to investigate the feasibility of the approach and an installation at the Timber International Forest Festival 2019. A technical description of each is provided alongside our own reflection and participant feedback, garnered from a soundwalk inspired approach to evaluation by audiences at the festival.},

  abstract = {John Dewey is, with Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, one ofthe leading early figures of the school of American Pragmatists. Hehas also had a great deal of influence in aesthetics and thephilosophy of art. His work Art as Experience (1934) isregarded by many as one of the most important contributions to thisarea in the twentieth century. The work is especially well-known forits full-blown treatment of aesthetic experience., Critical of attempts to limit aesthetic experience solely to thedomain of fine art, Art as Experience has had a highinfluence on trends in aesthetic research, which have sought tobroaden the scope of the field from the traditional arts to popularculture (Shusterman 1992, 2nd edition 2000), the naturalenvironment (Berleant 1997), and the everyday (Kupfer 1983, Saito2007, Stroud 2011, Leddy 2012). The work is also often seen as a keypart of Dewey's general late philosophical project, mostsystematically developed in Experience and Nature (1925), ofrethinking experience along naturalist lines as an interaction betweenthe organism and its environment as opposed to a discrete sensory unitsuch as stimulus, impression, idea, or sense-datum. Instead ofinvestigating how our senses are in touch with reality and whetherthey represent it correctly{\textemdash}which Dewey takes to be the frame ofmodern epistemology{\textemdash}Dewey's starting point, building onhis reading of Darwin's theory of evolution, is to look at theways in which experience is formed as a part of natural processes towhich the human being is fundamentally tied. For Dewey, aestheticexperience is the highest form of this interaction. It is the phasewhen, in Dewey's often used words, the interaction between theorganism and the environment reaches a stage of fulfillment. AlreadyExperience and Nature includes a chapter on aesthetics thethemes of which Dewey went on to develop in much greater depth anddetail in Art as Experience some ten years later. Due to thehigh value that Dewey places on aesthetic experience, Art asExperience has even been regarded as the culminating work ofDewey's late philosophical thinking (Alexander 2013).},

  abstract = {The term immersion or immersive is popularly used when describing and evaluating technologies in the area of extended reality (i.e., virtual/augmented/mixed reality). Much research been conducted on immersion over the last few decades. However, there is still a lack of consistency in how the term is defined in the literature. Presence and involvement are other prominent concepts studied in the field of extended reality. However, there is currently no consensus on their relationship with immersion among researchers. This paper first discusses different dimensions of immersion as well as those of presence and involvement, aiming to resolve potential confusion around the terms and synthesise a relationship among them. From this, a new conceptual model of immersive experience for future studies in extended reality is proposed. The model defines physical presence, social/self presence and involvement as the main high-level attributes that collectively lead to an immersive experience. Each pair of the three attributes shares a common lower-level attribute of sensory, narrative or task/motor engagement, which is an initial step towards the higher-level experience. Plausibility, interactivity and interestingness are defined as the main properties of immersive system and content, each of which is biased by a subjective factor: internal reference, skills/knowledge and personal preference, respectively.},

A series of experiments explored, for isolated tones and 2-note intervals, the occurrence of effects analogous to the spatial numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect. Response device orientation (horizontal vs. vertical), task, and musical expertise of the participants were manipulated. The pitch of isolated tones triggered the automatic activation of a vertical axis independently of musical expertise, but the contour of melodic intervals did not. By contrast, automatic associations with the horizontal axis seemed linked to music training for pitch and, to a lower extent, for intervals. These results, discussed in the light of studies on number representation, provide a new example of the effects of musical expertise on music cognition.},

We present ARchitect, a proof-of-concept prototype that allows flexible customization of a VR experience with human-in-the-loop. ARchitect brings in an assistant to map physical objects to virtual proxies of matching affordances using Augmented Reality (AR). In a within-subjects study (9 user pairs) comparing ARchitect to a baseline condition, assistants and players experienced decreased workload and players showed increased VR presence and trust in the assistant. Finally, we defined design guidelines of ARchitect for future designers and implemented three demonstrative experiences.},

Our results show that subjects achieved the best accuracy using a speaker array physically located around the listener when stationary sounds were played, but that there was no difference in accuracy between the speaker array and the bone-conduction device for sounds that were moving, and that both devices outperformed standard headphones for moving sounds. Subjective comments by subjects following the experiment support this performance data.},

  abstract = {While there is an increased appreciation for integrating haptic feedback with audio-visual content, there is still a lack of understanding of how to quantify the added value of touch for a user's experience (UX) of multimedia content. Here we focus on three main concepts to measure this added value: UX, emotions, and expectations. We present a case study measuring the added value of haptic feedback for a standardized set of audio-visual content (i.e., short video clips), comparing two haptic stimulation modalities (i.e., mid-air vs. vibro-tactile stimuli). Our findings demonstrate that UX of hapticallyenhanced audio-visual content is perceived as a more pleasant, unpredictable, and creative experience. The users' overall liking increases together with a positive change of the users' expectations, independently from the haptic stimulation modality. We discuss how our approach provides the foundation for future work on developing a measurement model to predict the added value of haptic feedback for users' experiences within and beyond the multimedia context.},

  abstract = {Interactive technologies are transforming the ways in which people experience, interact and share information. Advances in technology have made it possible to generate real and virtual environments with breath-taking graphics and high-fidelity audio. However, without stimulating the other senses such as touch and smell, and even taste in some cases, such experiences feel hollow and fictitious; they lack realism. One of the main stumbling blocks for progress towards creating truly compelling multisensory experiences is the lack of appropriate tools and guidance for designing beyond audio-visual applications. Here we focus particularly on the sense of smell and how smell-based design can be enabled to create novel user experiences. We present a design toolkit for smell (i.e., OWidgets). The toolkit consists of a graphical user interface and the underlying software framework. The framework uses two main components: a Mapper and Scheduler facilitating the device-independent replication of olfactory experiences. We discuss how our toolkit reduces the complexity of designing with smell and enables a creative exploration based on specific design features. We conclude by reflecting on future directions to extend the toolkit and integrate it into the wider audio-visual ecosystem.},

The point of departure is the phenomenology of musical instruments, which leads to the exploration of designed artefacts as extensions of human cognition {\textendash} as scaffolding onto which we delegate parts of our cognitive processes. The paper succinctly emphasises the pronounced epistemic dimension of digital instruments when compared to acoustic instruments. Through the analysis of material epistemologies it is possible to describe the digital instrument as an               epistemic tool               : a designed tool with such a high degree of symbolic pertinence that it becomes a system of knowledge and thinking in its own terms. In conclusion, the paper rounds up the phenomenological and epistemological arguments, and points at issues in the design of digital musical instruments that are germane due to their strong aesthetic implications for musical culture.},

We're constructing a system of values that gives more rights and less responsibilities to AI (Artificial Intelligence) than to HI (Humanistic Intelligence). Whereas it is becoming common to separate the notions of IRL (In Real Life) and ``Augmented'' or ``Virtual'' Reality (AR, VR) into completely disparate realms with clearly delineated boundaries, we propose here the notion of ``All Reality'' to more holistically represent the links between these soon-to-be-outdated culturally accepted norms of various levels of consciousness. Inclusive in the notion of ``All Reality'' is also the idea of ``ethically aligned reality'', recognizing values-based biases, cultural norms, and applied ethics of the creators of technology.},

The article asks whether this form becomes irrelevant and `invisible' or if people end up with a new experience in which the spatial and information layers are equally important. The author also discusses the general dynamic between spatial form and information and how this might function differently in today's computer culture. Throughout the article, augmentation is reconceptualized as an idea and cultural and aesthetic practice rather than as technology. Various practices in professional and vernacular architecture and built environments, cinema, 20th-century art and media art are discussed in terms of augmentation.},

  abstract = {Reflective optical combiners like beam splitters and two way mirrors are used in AR to overlap digital contents on the users' hands or bodies. Augmentations are usually unidirectional, either reflecting virtual contents on the user's body (Situated Augmented Reality) or augmenting user's reflections with digital contents (AR mirrors). But many other novel possibilities remain unexplored. For example, users' hands, reflected inside a museum AR cabinet, can allow visitors to interact with the artifacts exhibited. Projecting on the user's hands as their reflection cuts through the objects can be used to reveal objects' internals. Augmentations from both sides are blended by the combiner, so they are consistently seen by any number of users, independently of their location or, even, the side of the combiner through which they are looking. This paper explores the potential of optical combiners to merge the space in front and behind them. We present this design space, identify novel augmentations/interaction opportunities and explore the design space using three prototypes.},

With online hate speech culminating in gruesome scenarios like the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar, anti-Muslim mob violence in Sri Lanka, and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, there is a dire need to understand the dynamics of user interaction that facilitate the spread of such hateful content. In this paper, we perform the first study that looks into the diffusion dynamics of the posts made by hateful and non-hateful users on Gab1. We collect a massive dataset of 341K users with 21M posts and investigate the diffusion of the posts generated by hateful and non-hateful users. We observe that the content generated by the hateful users tend to spread faster, farther and reach a much wider audience as compared to the content generated by normal users. We further analyze the hateful and non-hateful users on the basis of their account and network characteristics. An important finding is that the hateful users are far more densely connected among themselves. Overall, our study provides the first cross-sectional view of how hateful users diffuse hate content in online social media.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter examines user experience design for collaborative music making in shared virtual environments (SVEs). Whilst SVEs have been extensively researched for many application domains including education, entertainment, work and training, there is limited research on the creative aspects. This results in many unanswered design questions such as how to design the user experience without being detrimental to the creative output, and how to design spatial configurations to support both individual creativity and collaboration. Here, we explore multi-modal approaches to supporting creativity in collaborative music making in SVEs. We outline an SVE, LeMo, which allows two people to create music collaboratively. We then present two studies; the first explores how free-form visual 3D annotations instead of spoken communication can support collaborative composition processes and human{\textendash}human interaction. Five classes of use of annotation were identified in the study, three of which are particularly relevant to the future design of sonic interactions in virtual environments. The second study used a modified version of LeMo to test the support for a creative collaboration of two different spatial audio settings, which according to the results, changed participants' behaviour and affected their collaboration. Finally, design implications for the auditory design of SVEs focusing on supporting creative collaboration are given.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the effects of different spatial sound configurations on visual attention and cognitive effort in an immersive environment. For that purpose, different groups of people were exposed to the same immersive video, but with different soundtrack conditions: mono, stereo, 5.1 and 7.4.1. The different sound conditions consisted of different artistic adaptations of the same soundtrack. During the visualization of the video, participants wore an eye-tracking device and were asked to perform a counting task. Gaze direction and pupil dilation metrics were obtained, as measures of attention and cognitive effort. Results demonstrate that the conditions 5.1 and 7.4.1 were associated with larger distributions of the visual attention, with subjects spending more time gazing at task-irrelevant areas on the screen. The sound condition which led to more concentrated attention on the task-relevant area was mono. The wider the spatial sound configuration, the greater the gaze distribution. Conditions 7.4.1 and 5.1 were also associated with larger pupil dilations than the mono and stereo conditions, showing that these conditions might lead to increased cognitive demand and therefore increased task difficulty. We conclude that sound design should be carefully planned to prevent visual distraction. More surrounding spatialized sounds may lead to more distraction and more difficulty in following audiovisual contents than less distributed sounds. We propose that sound spatialization and soundtrack design should be adapted to the audiovisual content and the task at hand, varying in immersiveness accordingly.},

However, most research has focused on task performance measures and often ignored user experience and engagement. We present an examination of crossmodal congruence in terms of performance and engagement in the context of a memory task of audio, visual, and audio-visual stimuli. Participants in a first study showed improved performance when using a visual congruent mapping that was cancelled by the addition of audio to the baseline conditions, and a subjective preference for the audio-visual stimulus that was not reflected in the objective data. Based on these findings, we designed an audio-visual memory game to examine the effects of crossmodal congruence on user experience and engagement. Results showed higher engagement levels with congruent displays with some reported preference for potential challenge and enjoyment that an incongruent display may support, particularly for increased task complexity.},

Augmented Reality (AR), probably the best known of these, refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are identified. However quite different groupings are possible and this demonstrates the need for an efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which essential differences can be identified. An approximately three-dimensional taxonomy is proposed comprising the following dimensions: extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor.},

Designing the appearance and directing the user experience are equally important for creating an engaging, immersive experience. We found that mixed reality artworks provide a very good test bed for studying these topics. This chapter details three steps required for authoring mixed reality experiences: engineering, designing and directing. We will describe a platform (VGE) for creating mixed reality environments that incorporates these steps. A case study (EI4) is presented in which this platform was used to not only engineer the system, but in which an artist was given the freedom to explore the artistic merits of mixed reality as an artistic medium, which involved areas such as the look and feel, multimodal experience and interaction, immersion as a subjective emotion and game play scenarios.},

Prominent subjects include higher sensory area, distributed assemblies bound by synchronization of neuronal activity and neurons in specific cortical laminae. In contrast, it has been suggested that the quality of sensory awareness is determined by systematic change of afferent signals resulting from behaviour and knowledge thereof. Support for such skill-based theories of perception is provided by experiments on sensory substitution. Here, we pursue this line of thought and create new sensorimotor contingencies and, hence, a new quality of perception. Adult subjects received orientation information, obtained by a magnetic compass, via vibrotactile stimulation around the waist. After six weeks of training we evaluated integration of the new input by a battery of tests. The results indicate that the sensory information provided by the belt (1) is processed and boosts performance, (2) if inconsistent with other sensory signals leads to variable performance, (3) does interact with the vestibular nystagmus and (4) in half of the experimental subjects leads to qualitative changes of sensory experience. These data support the hypothesis that new sensorimotor contingencies can be learned and integrated into behaviour and affect perceptual experience.},

Through interviews with HCI experts who have engaged in variations of autobiographical design, we draw out the possibilities and limitations of autobiographical design methods and lay out best practices for its use as an HCI research method.},

Although the AR community has not yet agreed on a formal definition of AR, some work focused on proposing classifications of existing AR methods or applications. Such applications cover a wide variety of technologies, devices and goals, consequently existing taxonomies rely on multiple classification criteria that try to take into account AR applications diversity. In this paper we review existing taxonomies of augmented reality applications and we propose our own, which is based on (1) the number of degrees of freedom required by the application, as well as on (2) the visualization mode used, (3) the temporal base of the displayed content and (4) the rendering modalities used in the application. Our taxonomy covers location-based services as well as more traditional visionbased AR applications. Although AR is mainly based on the visual sense, other rendering modalities are also covered by the same degree-of-freedom criterion in our classification.},

This article approaches space from the low level of musical structure, with a multi-dimensional attitude to space-form, exploring               spatial texture               , a concept introduced by Smalley to describe the temporal formations of space in spectromorphology (1997). Spatial articulation is investigated in the context of granular-oriented textures, proposing a micro-spatial, perceptual morphology {\textendash} the               texton               {\textendash} as an aesthetic approach to acousmatic music. This follows Albert Bregman's speculation regarding equivalents to visual perception in texture, where the theory of textons was first developed by the neuroscientist B{\'e}la Julesz.                          The article discusses acousmatic textons, in terms of intrinsic properties, the way they propagate in time, and how they organise in distributions to form spatial textures. The emergent macroscopic qualities of textonal formations are also reflected upon in the introduction of a group of textural states, where source-bonded spaces and abstract musical thinking coalesce.},

  abstract = {Low-level topology of spatial texture is here introduced as the basis of an aesthetic principle of sonic texture and spatial structure in electroacoustic music. The term spatial texture is used to describe aggregate sound structures which have a perceived three-dimensional spatial presence, specifically meaning that they occupy several areas or a stretch of horizontal perspectival space1 whilst also having a dynamic behaviour in spectral space2. The word topology refers to properties, qualities and structural features which remain distinct to a texture despite continuous change or recurrent incarnations in different specific shapes throughout a work.3 Ultimately, topology of spatial texture may be thought of as the core principle behind an attitude to music which considers all elements of structure to be part of an elastic spatiotemporal sound fabric. Rather than conceiving a work as built from time-finite morphological `objects', this view emphasises processes of deformation, where any singular shapes may be seen as instances of textural topologies. The terminology presented here is intended as a contribution to discourse on spatiality in music, with special relevance to multichannel compositions.4 This article focuses on the low-level, internal, structure of a spatial texture.},

We mostly rely on vision and audition, increasingly harnessing touch, whilst taste and smell remain largely underexploited. In spite of our current knowledge about sensory systems and sensory devices, the biggest stumbling block for progress concerns the need for a deeper understanding of people's multisensory experiences in HCI. It is essential to determine what tactile, gustatory, and olfactory experiences we can design for, and how we can meaningfully stimulate such experiences when interacting with technology. Importantly, we need to determine the contribution of the different senses along with their interactions in order to design more effective and engaging digital multisensory experiences. Finally, it is vital to understand what the limitations are that come into play when users need to monitor more than one sense at a time. The aim of this workshop is to deepen and expand the discussion on touch, taste, and smell within the CHI community and promote the relevance of multisensory experience design and research in HCI.},

However, both AVG and VR clearly afford opportunities to bring experiences, technologies, and users' physical and experiential bodies together, and to study and teach these open-ended relationships of enaction and meaning-making in the framework of embodied interaction. Without such a framework, an aesthetic pleasure, lasting satisfaction, and enjoyment would be impossible to achieve in designing sonic interactions in virtual environments (SIVE). In this chapter, we introduce this framework and focus on design exemplars that come from a soma design ideation workshop and balance rehabilitation. Within the field of physiotherapy, developing new conceptual interventions, with a more patient-centered approach, is still scarce but has huge potential for overcoming some of the challenges facing health care. We indicate how the tactics such as making space, subtle guidance, defamiliarization, and intimate correspondence have informed the exemplars, both in the workshop and also in our ongoing physiotherapy case. Implications for these tactics and design strategies for our design, as well as for general practitioners of SIVE are outlined.},

  abstract = {The sound of practically all traditional musical instruments is unique and depends on the collective behavior of various vibrators, each one with their own acoustic and mechanical properties. If we pluck a string of an acoustic guitar, a part of the wave is reflected by the sound box, and the other fraction of the elastic energy sets in motion the sound box surfaces. Thereby, the vibration of the surfaces (soundboard, ribs, back and sound hole), are the basis of the guitar sound production.In this work, we explore the effect of locally coupling tunable mechanical metamaterials to the soundboard of an acoustic guitar, in order to absorb specific ranges of frequencies and change its vibrational properties. We show the preliminary results of our research, which involves a mechano-acoustic characterization of tunable mechanical metamaterials and the analysis of the effect of applying them to an acoustic guitar when a string tuned to a convenient frequency is plucked. We observe that this simple mechanism is an alternative to manipulate the spectral properties of the sound signal produced by the instrument. Although the results are inaudible, they seem promising for future explorations of sound manipulation of musical instruments.},

More specifically the present contribution aims to set out an option for a reflection on the relationship between art education and augmented reality technologies from the didactic mediation point of view, with reference to a shared and collaborative construction of knowledge of artistic and cultural heritage.},

The 3D modeller is driven by a new user interface known as Tinmith-Hand, which allows the user to control the modeller using a set of pinch gloves and hand tracking. These techniques allow user to supply their AR renderers with models that would previously have to be captured with manual, time-consuming, and/or expensive methods.},

Parameter mapping sonification was used to represent effective transiting radii measurements through subtractive synthesis and spatialization. The design was considered to be effective, allowing the instantaneous identification of a water feature overlooked on a visual graph, even when noise within the dataset overlapped the source signal. The results suggest that multiple parameter mappings provide richer auditory stimuli and semantic qualities in order to allow an improved understanding of the dataset.},

  abstract = {Augmented reality audio (ARA) combines virtual sound sources with the real sonic environment of the user. An ARA system can be realized with a headset containing binaural microphones. Ideally, the ARA headset should be acoustically transparent, that is, it should not cause audible modification to the surrounding sound. A practical implementation of an ARA mixer requires a low-latency headphone reproduction system with additional equalization to compensate for the attenuation and the modified ear canal resonances caused by the headphones. This paper proposes digital IIR filters to realize the required equalization and evaluates a real-time prototype ARA system. Measurements show that the throughput latency of the digital prototype ARA system can be less than 1.4\,ms, which is sufficiently small in practice. When the direct and processed sounds are combined in the ear, a comb filtering effect is brought about and appears as notches in the frequency response. The comb filter effect in speech and music signals was studied in a listening test and it was found to be inaudible when the attenuation is 20\,dB. Insert ARA headphones have a sufficient attenuation at frequencies above about 1\,kHz. The proposed digital ARA system enables several immersive audio applications, such as a virtual audio tourist guide and audio teleconferencing.},

  abstract = {During life, many personal changes occur. These include changing house, school, work, and even friends and partners. However, the daily experience shows clearly that, in some situations, subjects are unable to change even if they want to. The recent advances in psychology and neuroscience are now providing a better view of personal change, the change affecting our assumptive world: (a) the focus of personal change is reducing the distance between self and reality (conflict); (b) this reduction is achieved through (1) an intense focus on the particular experience creating the conflict or (2) an internal or external reorganization of this experience; (c) personal change requires a progression through a series of different stages that however happen in discontinuous and non-linear ways; and (d) clinical psychology is often used to facilitate personal change when subjects are unable to move forward. Starting from these premises, the aim of this paper is to review the potential of virtuality for enhancing the processes of personal and clinical change. First, the paper focuses on the two leading virtual technologies {\textendash} augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) {\textendash} exploring their current uses in behavioral health and the outcomes of the 28 available systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Then the paper discusses the added value provided by VR and AR in transforming our external experience by focusing on the high level of personal efficacy and self-reflectiveness generated by their sense of presence and emotional engagement. Finally, it outlines the potential future use of virtuality for transforming our inner experience by structuring, altering, and/ or replacing our bodily self-consciousness. The final outcome may be a new generation of transformative experiences that provide knowledge that is epistemically inaccessible to the individual until he or she has that experience, while at the same time transforming the individual's worldview.},

  abstract = {Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.},

This aesthetic field of investigation has led to a reassessment of representation, one that is not without (1) sharing some of the fundamental concerns of current neuroscientific investigation of mental processes and (2) questioning the image/real continuum principle at the core of recent augmented reality technology research. The article examines media artist Bill Viola's The Passions series (2000{\textendash}2001) to contend that new media's original contribution to the practice of hybridity lies in the interaction that it both articulates and encourages with affective sciences, an interaction that redefines representation as an approximation, a facilitator {\textendash} a projection screen for complex mental processes.},

Both the basic elements of mathematical cognition (i.e. numbers) and the basic elements of musical cognition (i.e. pitches), appear to be mapped onto a mental spatial representation in a way that affects motor performance.},

Besides smartphone platforms, early-stage head-mounted displays such as the Microsoft HoloLens are under active development. Many compelling uses of these technologies are multi-user: e.g., inperson collaborative tools, multiplayer gaming, and telepresence. While prior work on AR security and privacy has studied potential risks from AR applications, new risks will also arise among multiple human users. In this work, we explore the challenges that arise in designing secure and private content sharing for multi-user AR. We analyze representative application case studies and systematize design goals for security and functionality that a multi-user AR platform should support. We design an AR content sharing control module that achieves these goals and build a prototype implementation (ShareAR) for the HoloLens. This work builds foundations for secure and private multi-user AR interactions.},

Classical definitions based on logic seem to be inadequate to describe their aesthetic capabilities. New approaches stress their involvement in material practices as well as their incompleteness. Algorithmic aesthetics can no longer be tied to the static analysis of programs, but must take into account the dynamic and experimental nature of coding practices. It is suggested that the aesthetic objects thus produced articulate something that could be called algorithmicity or the space of algorithmic agency. This is the space or the medium {\textendash}following Luhmann's form/medium distinction {\textendash} where human and machine undergo mutual incursions. In the resulting coupled ``extimate'' writing process, human initiative and algorithmic speculation cannot be clearly divided out any longer. An observation is attempted of defining aspects of such a medium by drawing a trajectory across a number of sound pieces. The operation of exchange between form and medium I call reconfiguration and it is indicated by this trajectory.},

This paper presents the development of a framework for creating AR gesture-based scores in the context of experimental instrumental composition. The notation system is made possible by GesturAR, an Augmented Reality software developed by the author: it allows one to draw trajectories of gestures directly on the real vibrating body. Those trajectories are visualized as lines moving in real-time with a predetermined speed. The user can also create an AR score (a sequence of trajectories) by arranging miniaturized trajectories representations on a timeline. The timeline is then processed and a set of events is created. This application paves the way to a new kind of notation: embodied interactive notation, characterized by a mimetic 4D representation of gesture, where the act of notation (performed by the composer during the compositional process) corresponds to the notated act (i.e., the action the interpreter is meant to produce during the performance).},

No significant differences are found between stationary and mobile-user scenarios when comparing the angular miss distances of the perceived center of sonified shapes, but significant differences are identified in locating their left and top edges. Further research is warranted to determine why properties of some shapes are easier to pinpoint than others, and how sonification may be improved to minimize such discrepancies.},

While this has stimulated important discussions and debates across a vast array of disciplines, its principles, applications, and explanatory power have not yet been properly addressed in the domain of musical development. Accordingly, it remains unclear how the cognitive processes involved in the acquisition of musical skills might be understood through the lenses of this approach, and what this might offer for practical areas like music education. To begin filling this gap, the present contribution aims to explore central aspects of music pedagogy through the lenses of 4E cognitive science. By discussing cross-disciplinary research in music, pedagogy, psychology, and philosophy of mind, we will provide novel insights that may help inspire a richer understanding of what musical learning entails. In doing so, we will develop conceptual bridges between the notion of `autopoiesis' (the property of continuous self-regeneration that characterizes living systems) and the emergent dynamics contributing to the flourishing of one's musical life. This will reveal important continuities between a number of new teaching approaches and principles of self-organization. In conclusion, we will briefly consider how these conceptual tools align with recent work in interactive cognition and collective music pedagogy, promoting the close collaboration of musicians, pedagogues, and cognitive scientists.},

We argue that multimodality in AR is the norm rather than the exception, as AR environments consist of both virtual content and our real, physical, multimodal world. We explore the role multimodal and non-visual aspects of our physical reality can play when creating AR scenarios and the possibilities and challenges that emerge when approaching AR from a modalitiesencompassing perspective.},

  abstract = {The spacesuit, particularly the spacesuit glove, creates a barrier between astronauts and their environment. Motivated by the vision of facilitating full-body immersion for effortless space exploration, it is necessary to understand the sensory needs of astronauts during extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). In this paper, we present the outcomes from a two-week field study performed at the Mars Desert Research Station, a facility where crews carry out Marssimulated missions. We used a combination of methods (a haptic logbook, technology probes, and interviews) to investigate user needs for haptic feedback in EVAs in order to inform the design of a haptic glove. Our results contradict the common belief that a haptic technology should always convey as much information as possible, but should rather offer a controllable transfer. Based on these findings, we identified two main design requirements to enhance haptic feedback through the glove: (i) transfer of the shape and pressure features of haptic information and (ii) control of the amount of haptic information. We present the implementation of these design requirements in the form of the concept and first prototype of ExoSkin. ExoSkin is a morphing haptic feedback layer that augments spacesuit gloves by controlling the transfer of haptic information from the outside world onto the astronauts' skin.},

The model is based on interoceptive prediction error and is informed by predictive models of agency, general models of hierarchical predictive coding and dopaminergic signaling in cortex, the role of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in interoception and emotion, and cognitive neuroscience evidence from studies of virtual reality and of psychiatric disorders of presence, specifically depersonalization/derealization disorder. The model associates presence with successful suppression by top-down predictions of informative interoceptive signals evoked by autonomic control signals and, indirectly, by visceral responses to afferent sensory signals. The model connects presence to agency by allowing that predicted interoceptive signals will depend on whether afferent sensory signals are determined, by a parallel predictive-coding mechanism, to be self-generated or externally caused. Anatomically, we identify the AIC as the likely locus of key neural comparator mechanisms. Our model integrates a broad range of previously disparate evidence, makes predictions for conjoint manipulations of agency and presence, offers a new view of emotion as interoceptive inference, and represents a step toward a mechanistic account of a fundamental phenomenological property of consciousness.},

This paper is concerned with the questions whether the electronic music of today takes into account the perception of its audience at all, whether it is necessary to have a typology of electronic music sounds at all, and how to find or generate terms that could be helpful for composition and analysis of spatialized sound. Before going into detail about how to deal with spatial phenomena, it is valuable to review the main concepts of verbalization of sound from the last 100 years of sound-based music. Following this, approaches and methodologies are introduced to develop a specific terminology for a certain way of spatial sound projection within the framework of the artistic research project `Orchestrating Space by Icosahedral Loudspeaker' (OSIL). By this we intent to encourage the aesthetic discussion about spatial sound composition and therefore enlarge the compositional contingencies of this art.},

The work was constituted by two structural elements: a large projection screen and an optical viewing console with an automated pair of slide projectors. Because of the screen's retro-reflective properties (it was made from 3M Scotchlite), the projected image was only visible through the viewing console. From every other position in the room the screen appeared as a plain grey surface. This optical projection system was so inherently bright that it could match the ambient lighting in the museum exactly, and a perceptual conjunction of the projected images with the surroundings could thus be achieved. Furthermore, these projected images showed the exact portion of the museum environment that was hidden by the screen, creating a seamless continuity between the virtual and actual spaces.

The viewer could rotate and tilt monitor and, looking through the mirror, could discover various simple computer-generated virtual objects floating in different locations in the real space in front of them. The optical method is based on an illusion technique called `Pepper's ghost', which goes back to the 16th century. It is updated in the Virtual Sculpture by using a video image and a Fresnel lens to change the focal length so that this image appear some meters away when viewed through the semitransparent mirror. The system's rotate and tilt functions then allow these virtual images to be physically distributed all around the viewer {\textendash} a virtual reality paradigm inspired by Ivan Sutherland's `Sword of Damocles' (1968).~ The installation used an Apple II computer with its game paddles attached to the monitor to register the tilt and rotation movements.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a study to assess the influence of a variety of factors on reported level of presence in immersive virtual environments. It introduces the idea of ``stacking depth,'' that is, where a participant can simulate the process of entering the virtual environment while already in such an environment, which can be repeated to several levels of depth. An experimental study including 24 subjects was carried out. Half of the subjects were transported between environments by using virtual head-mounted displays, and the other half by going through doors. Three other binary factors were whether or not gravity operated, whether or not the subject experienced a virtual precipice, and whether or not the subject was followed around by a virtual actor. Visual, auditory, and kinesthetic representation systems and egocentric/exocentric perceptual positions were assessed by a preexperiment questionnaire. Presence was assessed by the subjects as their sense of ``being there,'' the extent to which they experienced the virtual environments as more the presenting reality than the real world in which the experiment was taking place, and the extent to which the subject experienced the virtual environments as places visited rather than images seen. A logistic regression analysis revealed that subjective reporting of presence was significantly positively associated with visual and kinesthetic representation systems, and negatively with the auditory system. This was not surprising since the virtual reality system used was primarily visual. The analysis also showed a significant and positive association with stacking level depth for those who were transported between environments by using the virtual HMD, and a negative association for those who were transported through doors. Finally, four of the subjects moved their real left arm to match movement of the left arm of the virtual body displayed by the system. These four scored significantly higher on the kinesthetic representation system than the remainder of the subjects.},

Thus, when touch is seen to be applied to a rubber hand while felt synchronously on the corresponding hidden real hand, an illusion of ownership of the rubber hand usually occurs. The illusion has also been demonstrated using visuomotor correlation between the movements of the hidden real hand and the seen fake hand. This type of paradigm has been used with respect to the whole body generating out-of-the-body and body substitution illusions. However, such studies have only ever manipulated a single factor and although they used a form of virtual reality have not exploited the power of immersive virtual reality (IVR) to produce radical transformations in body ownership.},

We argue that antecedents related to shorttermism and uncertainty avoidance reinforce each other at three levels {\textendash} individual, organizational and institutional {\textendash} and result in organizational inaction on climate change.

  abstract = {Abstract             The analytical discussion of acousmatic music can benefit from being based on spatial concepts, and this article aims to provide a framework for investigation. A personal experience of soundscape listening is the starting point, and uncovers basic ideas relating to the disposition and behaviour of sounding content, and listening strategy. This enables the opening out of the discussion to include source-bonded sounds in general, giving particular consideration to how experience of sense modes other than the aural are implicated in our understanding of space, and in acousmatic listening. Attention then shifts to a source-bonded spatial model based on the production of space by the gestural activity of music performance, prior to focusing in more detail on acousmatic music, initially by delving into spectral space, where ideas about gravitation and diagonal forces are germane. This leads to concepts central to the structuring of perspectival space in relation to the vantage point of the listener. The final section considers a methodology for space-form investigation.},

  abstract = {What is Mixed Reality (MR)? To revisit this question given the many recent developments, we conducted interviews with ten AR/VR experts from academia and industry, as well as a literature survey of 68 papers. We find that, while there are prominent examples, there is no universally agreed on, one-size-fits-all definition of MR. Rather, we identified six partially competing notions from the literature and experts' responses. We then started to isolate the different aspects of reality relevant for MR experiences, going beyond the primarily visual notions and extending to audio, motion, haptics, taste, and smell. We distill our findings into a conceptual framework with seven dimensions to characterize MR applications in terms of the number of environments, number of users, level of immersion, level of virtuality, degree of interaction, input, and output. Our goal with this paper is to support classification and discussion of MR applications' design and provide a better means to researchers to contextualize their work within the increasingly fragmented MR landscape.},

  abstract = {The majority of researchers agree that olfactory cues play a dominant role in our perception and enjoyment of the taste (or rather flavour) of food and drink. It is no surprise then that in recent years, a variety of modern (or dare we say it, modernist) solutions have been developed with the explicit aim of delivering an enhanced olfactory input to the diners/dishes served in the restaurant, and occasionally also in the home setting too. Such innovations include everything from aromatic cutlery and plateware through to the use of atomizers and dry ice. A few augmented reality (AR; i.e. an experience of a physical, real-world environment whose elements have been augmented, or supplemented, by computer-generated sensory input) solutions have also made their way out from well-funded technology labs, and scent-enabled plug-ins for mobile devices are slowly being commercialized. The latter could potentially be used to enhance the orthonasal olfactory component of our multisensory food experiences in the years to come. Ultimately, though, there is an important question here as to the authenticity of those food and flavour experiences that have been augmented/enhanced by aroma and fragrance cues that are not integral to the food or drink itself. It is this lack of authenticity that may, at least in your authors' humble opinion, limit the more widespread uptake of such a sense-by-sense approach to the contemporary construction of multisensory gastronomic experiences. The challenge, as always, remains to find the unique selling point (USP) of such approaches to olfactory stimulation, over and above their mere feasibility and inherent theatricality.},

We report a large-scale online survey (N=124) on privacy aspects of eye tracking that provides the first comprehensive account of with whom, for which services, and to what extent users are willing to share their gaze data. Using these insights, we design a privacy-aware VR interface that uses differential privacy, which we evaluate on a new 20-participant dataset for two privacy sensitive tasks: We show that our method can prevent user re-identification and protect gender information while maintaining high performance for gaze-based document type classification. Our results highlight the privacy challenges particular to gaze data and demonstrate that differential privacy is a potential means to address them. Thus, this paper lays important foundations for future research on privacy-aware gaze interfaces.},

  abstract = {Traditional art exhibitions are typically limited to artworks being viewed on the walls of galleries and museums. While walking around galleries, viewers often view artworks spontaneously within a matter of a few seconds or minutes. The act of viewing artworks can take many forms; one might quickly glance at the works, or stare at them, or intensely view the works as a whole group and/or in part. The frequent assumption is that the artist is communicating their vision from one direction. This paper explores how augmented reality art (AR) has affected viewing behaviours and norms, and the ways in which viewers experience traditional paintings, as well as new media arts. Based on Cecilia Suhr's invitational solo exhibition, Flame, at the Nameseoul University IANG Gallery in Seoul, Korea, in May 2017, the goal of this paper is threefold: 1) to unpack the conceptual framework of the Flame series by loosely drawing on Deleuze's notion of ``becoming''; 2) to explore audiences' viewing behaviours of AR art in relation to the inherent characteristics and ontology of the AR medium; and 3) to problematise how the AR medium affects the hegemonic tension between artist and audience in the dichotomisation of active/passive audiences.},

  abstract = {Identifying with a body is central to being a conscious self. The now classic ``rubber hand illusion'' demonstrates that the experience of body-ownership can be modulated by manipulating the timing of exteroceptive (visual and tactile) body-related feedback. Moreover, the strength of this modulation is related to individual differences in sensitivity to internal bodily signals (interoception). However the interaction of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals in determining the experience of body-ownership within an individual remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that this depends on the online integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive signals by implementing an innovative ``cardiac rubber hand illusion'' that combined computer-generated augmented-reality with feedback of interoceptive (cardiac) information. We show that both subjective and objective measures of virtual-hand ownership are enhanced by cardio-visual feedback in-time with the actual heartbeat, as compared to asynchronous feedback. We further show that these measures correlate with individual differences in interoceptive sensitivity, and are also modulated by the integration of proprioceptive signals instantiated using realtime visual remapping of finger movements to the virtual hand. Our results demonstrate that interoceptive signals directly influence the experience of body ownership via multisensory integration, and they lend support to models of conscious selfhood based on interoceptive predictive coding.},

In a first experiment, participants manipulated novel virtual 3D objects, viewed through a head-mounted display, using three interlocking cogs. This setup allowed us to manipulate the sensorimotor contingencies governing interactions with virtual objects, while characterising the effects on subjective visual experience by measuring breakthrough times from bCFS. We contrasted the effects of the congruency (veridical versus reversed sensorimotor coupling) and contingency (live versus replayed interactions) using a motion discrimination task. The results showed that the contingency but not congruency of sensorimotor coupling affected breakthrough times, with live interactions displaying faster breakthrough times. In a second experiment, we investigated how the contingency of sensorimotor interactions affected object category discrimination within a more naturalistic setting, using a motion tracker that allowed object interactions with increased degrees of freedom. We again found that breakthrough times were faster for live compared to replayed interactions (contingency effect). Together, these data demonstrate that bCFS breakthrough times for unfamiliar 3D virtual objects are modulated by the contingency of the dynamic causal coupling between actions and their visual consequences, in line with theories of perception that emphasise the influence of sensorimotor contingencies on visual experience. The combination of VR/AR and motion tracking technologies with bCFS provides a novel methodology extending the use of binocular suppression paradigms into more dynamic and realistic sensorimotor environments.},

Moreover, I argue that this integration is not limited to just sensory inputs, but that internal cognitive processes also shape the resulting mental representation. Studies showing that memory recall is affected by the initial multisensory context in which the stimuli were presented will be discussed, as well as several studies showing that mental imagery can affect multisensory illusions. This empirical evidence will be discussed from a predictive coding perspective, in which a central top{\textendash}down attentional process is proposed to play a central role in coordinating the integration of all these inputs into a coherent mental representation.},

It is in this context that we conducted a study aiming at proposing and validating a unified questionnaire on User eXperience in Immersive Virtual Environment. Our questionnaire contains 10 scales measuring presence, engagement, immersion, flow, usability, skill, emotion, experience consequence, judgement and technology adoption. Scale construction was based on existing questionnaires. Our questionnaire was tested on 116 participants after they use the edutainment Virtual Environment ``Think and Shoot''. The number of participants allows us to assess the reliability and the sensitivity of our questionnaire. Results show that 9 out of 10 subscales and 68 out of 87 items are reliable as demonstrated by an internal consistency analysis with Cronbach's alpha and an item analysis. Findings also indicate that the scale scores from 6 subscales are considered normal distributed (e.g. presence) whereas the scale scores from 3 subscales are considered negatively skewed (e.g. skill).},

  abstract = {Augmented reality audio (ARA) means mixing the natural sound environment with artificially created sound scenes. This requires that the perception of natural environment has to be preserved as well as possible, unless some modification to it is desired. A basic ARA headset consists of binaural microphones, an amplifier/mixer, and earphones feeding sound to the ear canals. All these components more or less change the perceived sound scene. In this paper we describe an ARA headset, equalization of its response, and particularly the results of a usability study. The usability was tested by subjects wearing the headset for relatively long periods in different environments of their everyday-life conditions. The goal was to find out what works well and what are the problems in lengthened use. It was found that acoustically the headset worked fine in most occasions when equalized individually or generically (averaged over several subjects). The main problems of usage were related to handling inconveniences and special environments.},

  abstract = {Representation of pitch in horizontal space and its relationship to musical and instrumental experience was examined in three behavioral experiments. Each experiment investigated the influence of a task-irrelevant dimension (pitch or location) on the perception of a taskrelevant dimension (location or pitch, respectively). Sine tones with nine different pitches were presented from nine locations, and participants estimated the pitch or location of the stimuli. Experiment 1 showed an influence of the (task irrelevant) pitch of presented stimuli on the perceived location of the stimuli in musically experienced participants only. This influence increased with the degree of musical training of participants. No influence was found of presented location on the perception of pitch. Experiments 2 and 3 investigated the influence of instrumental expertise comparing the responses of a group of flutists with a group of pianists. An interaction with instrumental expertise was found only in Experiment 3, where participants played shortly on their respective instruments before doing the perceptual judgments. The experiments indicate that musical training in general influence the pitchlocation association, and pianistic experience in particular.},

This paper draws on recent developments in the field of New Aesthetics and New Phenomenology. In particular, the research work highlights the role a sonic atmosphere has as a backdrop of the acoustic environment and the soundscape, and explores the relationships existing among these concepts. This provides us with a reference framework for studying movement through and between sonic atmospheres and to understand the possible relationships unfolding between an individual' s mood and the affective tonality and affordances of a sonic space. A case study exemplifies the application of the proposed conceptual framework in the field of urban design.},

Various implemented use cases are presented, which leverage the smart qualities of the instrument. These include the programming of the instrument via applications for smartphones and desktop computer, as well as the wireless control of devices enabling multimodal performances such as screen projecting visuals, smartphones, and tactile devices used by the audience.

The use of XR technologies represents a fundamental paradigm shift for various musical contexts as they disrupt traditional notions of musical interaction by enabling performers and audiences to interact musically with virtual objects, agents, and environments. This article both surveys and expands upon the knowledge accumulated in existing research in this area to build a foundation for future works that bring together Music and XR. To this end, we created a freely available dataset of 260 publications in this space and conducted an in-depth analysis covering 199 works in the last decade. We conducted this analysis using a list of conceptual dimensions belonging to technical, artistic, perceptual and methodological domains. This review of the literature is complemented with a set of interviews with domain experts with the goal of establishing a definition for the emergent field of Musical XR, i.e., the field of music in Extended Realities. Based on the results of the conducted review, a research agenda for the field is proposed.},

With the rapid advance in non-desktop computing generated by powerful mobile devices and affordable sensors in recent years, multimodal research that leverages speech, touch, vision, and gesture is on the rise. This paper provides a brief and personal review of some of the key aspects and issues in multimodal interaction, touching on the history, opportunities, and challenges of the area, especially in the area of multimodal integration. We review the question of early vs. late integration and find inspiration in recent evidence in biological sensory integration.

An important objective of the project has been to encourage its use by practicing musicians. After ten years of use, the halldorophone has a growing repertoire of works by prominent composers and performers. During the development of the instrument, the question has been asked: ``why do musicians want to use this instrument?'' and answers have been found through on-going (informal) user studies and feedback. As the project progresses, a picture emerges of what qualities have led to a culture of acceptance and use around this new instrument. This paper describes the halldorophone and presents the rationale for its major design features and ergonomic choices, as they relate to the overarching objective of nurturing a culture of use and connects it to wider trends.},

The device allows performers to interactively accompany themselves through pushing, leaning on and bending steel wires. The design was guided by the unique needs of the solo-singer, explored through autobiographical design and material explorations, some on stage, and later tested by other singers. We discuss how designing for opera and for the stage requires extraordinary durability and how opera performances can change with a bodilyoriented instrument such as The Vocal Chorder. Through a designerly exploration, we arrived at a device that offered (1) a tool for singers to take control over the rhythmical pace and overall artistic and aesthetic outcome of their performances, (2) an enriched sense of embodiment between their voice and the overall performance; and (3) a means to empower opera singers on stage.},

We then conduct a user study, assessing the effect of acoustic levitation on users' taste perception, comparing three basic taste stimuli (i.e., sweet, bitter and umami) and three volume sizes of droplets (5{\textmu}L, 10{\textmu}L and 20{\textmu}L). Our results show that users perceive sweet and umami easily, even in minimal quantities, whereas bitter is the least detectable taste, despite its typical association with an unpleasant taste experience. Our results are a first step towards the creation of new culinary experiences and innovative gustatory interfaces.},

  abstract = {The use of the senses of vision and audition as interactive means has dominated the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for decades, even though nature has provided us with many more senses for perceiving and interacting with the world around us. That said, it has become attractive for HCI researchers and designers to harness touch, taste, and smell in interactive tasks and experience design. In this paper, we present research and design insights gained throughout an interdisciplinary collaboration on a six-week multisensory display {\textendash} Tate Sensorium {\textendash} exhibited at the Tate Britain art gallery in London, UK. This is a unique and first time case study on how to design art experiences whilst considering all the senses (i.e., vision, sound, touch, smell, and taste), in particular touch, which we exploited by capitalizing on a novel haptic technology, namely, mid-air haptics. We first describe the overall set up of Tate Sensorium and then move on to describing in detail the design process of the mid-air haptic feedback and its integration with sound for the Full Stop painting by John Latham (1961). This was the first time that mid-air haptic technology was used in a museum context over a prolonged period of time and integrated with sound to enhance the experience of visual art. As part of an interdisciplinary team of curators, sensory designers, sound artists, we selected a total of three variations of the mid-air haptic experience (i.e., haptic patterns), which were alternated at dedicated times throughout the six-week exhibition. We collected questionnaire-based feedback from 2500 visitors and conducted 50 interviews to gain quantitative and qualitative insights on visitors' experiences and emotional reactions. Whilst the questionnaire results are generally very positive with only a small variation of the visitors' arousal ratings across the three tactile experiences designed for the Full Stop painting, the interview data shed light on the differences in the visitors' subjective experiences. Our findings suggest multisensory designers and art curators can ensure a balance between surprising experiences versus the possibility of free exploration for visitors. In addition, participants expressed that experiencing art with the combination of mid-air haptic and sound was immersive and provided an up-lifting experience of touching without touch. We are convinced that the insights gained from this large-scale and real-world field exploration of multisensory experience design exploiting a new and emerging technology provide a solid starting point for the HCI community, creative industries, and art curators to think beyond conventional art experiences. Specifically, our work demonstrates how novel mid-air technology can make art more emotionally engaging and stimulating, especially abstract art that is often open to interpretation.},

In this paper, we first review prior works on gustatory interfaces and particularly discuss them based on the use of either a chemical, electrical and/or thermal stimulation approach. We then present two concepts for gustatory interfaces that represent a more traditional delivery approach (using a mouthpiece) versus a novel approach that is based on principles of acoustic levitation (contactless delivery). We discuss the design opportunities around those two concepts in particular to overcome challenges of "how" to stimulate the sense of taste.},

This interactive system was designed to foster a meditative experience by facilitating users' sense of immersion while following a specific attentional pattern characteristic of mindfulness. The goal of Sonic Cradle is twofold: first, to trigger the proven effects of mindfulness on stress, and second, to help teach and demystify the concept of meditation for users' long-term benefit. This paper presents the design phase of the project, starting by theoretically grounding the initial concept. We then discuss 15 co-design sessions which provided informal conceptual validation and led to several concrete design iterations aimed at balancing users' perceived sense of control. The presented approach to designing an interactive stress management system can be considered research through design, as it also resulted in a novel theoretical framework for the psychology of media immersion which has implications for a wide range of research areas.},

With this novel digital form, new opportunities for musical expression and interface are presented. Yet few works consider whether and how the design of the NIME will be affected given the technology's affordance. In this paper, we take an autobiographical design approach to design a NIME in HMAR, exploring what is a genuine application of AR in a NIMEs and how AR mediates between the performer and sound as a creative expression. Three interface prototypes are created for a frequency modulation synthesis system. We report on their design process and our learning and experiences through self-usage and improvisation. Our designs explore free-hand and embodied interaction in our interfaces, and we reflect on how these unique qualities of HMAR contribute to an expressive medium for sonic creation.},

This visual phenomenology, although triggered through use of The vOICe, is likely to depend not only on online visualization of the auditory signal but also on the users' previous (albeit distant) experience of veridical vision (e.g. knowledge of shapes and visual perspective). Once established, the sensory substitution mapping between the auditory and visual domains is not confined to when the device is worn and, thus, may constitute an example of acquired synaesthesia.},

The first stage, presence via altered embodiment, refers to the way technology allows us to experience the world with modified or enhanced senses. The second stage, via expanded embodiment, refers to technology pushing the envelope of the mental body in which one feels present, out beyond the physical body. Finally, distributed embodiment refers to how the sense of being present in the world can be separated from that of ownership of a particular body, through the development of new approaches to deploying the technologies of virtual realization. We suggest that presence is the yardstick of embodiment from an experiential perspective. If you cannot feel presence, you are not embodied in the world.},

  abstract = {Autoethnography is a form of qualitative research in which an author uses self-reflection and writing to explore their personal experience and connect this autobiographical story to wider cultural, political, and social meanings and understandings. Autoethnography is a self-reflective form of writing used across various disciplines such as communication studies, performance studies, education, English literature, anthropology, social work, sociology, history, psychology, marketing, business and educational administration, arts education and physiotherapy. According to Mar{\'e}chal (2010), "autoethnography is a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing" (p. 43). A well-known autoethnographer, Carolyn Ellis (2004) defines it as "research, writing, story, and method that connect the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political" (p. xix). However, it is not easy to reach a consensus on the term's definition. For instance, in the 1970s, autoethnography was more narrowly defined as "insider ethnography," referring to studies of the (culture of) a group of which the researcher is a member (Hayano, 1979). Nowadays, however, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) point out, "the meanings and applications of autoethnography have evolved in a manner that makes precise definition difficult" (p. 449). According to Adams, Jones, and Ellis in Autoethnography: Understanding Qualitative Research, "Autoethnography is a research method that: Uses a researcher's personal experience to describe and critique cultural beliefs, practices, and experiences. Acknowledges and values a researcher's relationships with others. . . . Shows 'people in the process of figuring out what to do, how to live, and the meaning of their struggles'" (Adams, 2015). "Social life is messy, uncertain, and emotional. If our desire to research social life, then we must embrace a research method that, to the best of its/our ability, acknowledges and accommodates mess and chaos, uncertainty and emotion" (Adams, 2015).},

Instead, they contain a speaker-independent representation of a sound field called B-format, which is then decoded to the listener's speaker setup. This extra step allows the producer to think in terms of source directions rather than loudspeaker positions, and offers the listener a considerable degree of flexibility as to the layout and number of speakers used for playback. Ambisonics was developed in the UK in the 1970s under the auspices of the British National Research Development Corporation. Despite its solid technical foundation and many advantages, Ambisonics had not until recently been a commercial success, and survived only in niche applications and among recording enthusiasts. With the easy availability of powerful digital signal processing (as opposed to the expensive and error-prone analog circuitry that had to be used during its early years) and the successful market introduction of home theatre surround sound systems since the 1990s, interest in Ambisonics among recording engineers, sound designers, composers, media companies, broadcasters and researchers has returned and continues to increase.},

Through comparing epistemic perspectives and reviewing the histories of introspection in several disciplines, we liberate the research field of experience-driven design from a long-lasting doubt about and the disguised and unsystematic use of this method. To establish a foundation for the further development of introspective methods, we focus on its most controversial type (i.e. researcher introspection) and discuss its strengths and weaknesses, preconditions of use, diverse ways to practise for different suitable experiencedriven design research purposes, and useful techniques and tools. {\'O} 2019 The Authors.

  abstract = {Audio augmented reality (AAR) applications need to render virtual sounds with acoustic effects that match the real environment of the user to create an experience with strong sense of presence. This audio rendering process can be formulated as the convolution between the dry sound signal and the room impulse response (IR) that covers the audible frequency spectrum (20Hz - 20kHz). While the IR can be pre-calculated in virtual reality (VR) scenes, AR applications need to continuously estimate it. We propose a method to synthesize room IRs based on the corresponding IR in the ultrasound frequency band (20kHz - 22kHz) and two parameters we propose in this paper: slope factor and RT60 ratio. We assess the synthesized IRs using common acoustic metrics and we conducted a user study to evaluate participants' perceptual similarity between the sounds rendered with the synthesized IR and with the recorded IR in different rooms. The method requires only a small number of pre-measurements in the environment to determine the synthesis parameters and it uses only inaudible signals at runtime for fast IR synthesis, making it well suited for interactive AAR applications.},

These choreographies could include spectators too, providing them with the possibility to directly modify the scene and its audio/visual features. We also introduce the rst interactive performance staged with this technology, in which an electronic musician played live ve tracks manipulating the 3D projected visuals. As questionnaires have been distributed after the show, in the last part of this work we discuss the analysis of collected data, underlining positive and negative aspects of the proposed experience. This paper belongs together with a performance proposal called Dissonance, in which two performers exploit the platform to create a progressive soundtrack along with the exploration of an interactive virtual environment.},

Being both digital musical instruments (DMIs) and elements of virtual environments (VEs), IVMIs have the potential to transport the musician into a world of imagination and unprecedented musical expression. But when the final aim is to perform live on stage, the employment of these technologies is anything but straightforward, for sharing the virtual musical experience with the audience gets quite arduous. In this chapter, we assess in detail the several technical and conceptual challenges linked to the composition of IVMI performances on stage, i.e., their               scenography               , providing a new critical perspective on IVMI performance and design. We first propose a set of dimensions meant to analyse IVMI scenographies, as well as to evaluate their compatibility with different instrument metaphors and performance rationales. Such dimensions are built from the specifics and constraints of DMIs and VEs; they include the level of immersion of musicians and spectators and provide an insight into the interaction techniques afforded by 3D user interfaces in the context of musical expression. We then analyse a number of existing IVMIs and stage setups, and finally suggest new ones, with the aim to facilitate the design of future immersive performances.},

  abstract = {In this essay, I argue that the late ontology of Maurice MerleauPonty, in particular the system he began to develop in The Visible and the Invisible, can be conceived of as a form of Radical Enactive Cognition, as described by Hutto and Myin in Radicalizing Enactivism. I will begin by discussing Clark and Chalmers' extended mind hypothesis, as well as the enactive view of consciousness proposed by Varela, Thompson, and Rosch in The Embodied Mind. However, neither Clark and Chalmers' extended mind hypothesis nor the enactive view of consciousness advanced by Varela et al. are radical enough to fully capture Merleau-Ponty's late ontology. Inasmuch as Hutto and Myin's formulation combines features of the extended mind thesis and enactivism, and expresses both in a sufficiently radical fashion, it overcomes the deficits of both theories and can serve as a translation, so to speak, of MerleauPonty's ``ontology of the flesh'' into contemporary terms. In particular, their formulation makes explicit several central aspects of his theory: the intimate, mutually constitutive relationship between perceiver and perceived world, the equal weight given to the contributions of perceiver and world within this relationship, and the displacement of representational content from its central position in the understanding of consciousness. It is thus the ideal vehicle for demonstrating some perhaps unexpected ways in which Merleau-Ponty's thought is compatible with contemporary conversations concerning the nature of mind.},

Recent advances in Mixed Reality (MR) experiences have provided the means for a new wave of research that goes beyond Virtual Reality. In this paper, we explore the taxonomy of Extended Reality systems, establishing our own notion of MR. From this, we propose a new classification of Virtual Musical Instrument, known as a Mixed Reality Musical Instrument (MRMI). We define this system as an embodied interface for expressive musical performance, characterized by the relationships between the performer, the virtual, and the physical environment. After a review of existing literature concerning the evaluation of immersive musical instruments and the affordances of MR systems, we offer a new framework based on three dimensions to support the design and analysis of MRMIs. We illustrate its use with application to existing works.},
