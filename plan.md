        Digital entities in performance demand a kind of ‘collective hallucination’, to borrow William Gibson’s fictional description of a system that enables direct interface between mind and data (Rey 2012). Physical and digital ‘dancers’ must be simultaneously perceived as part of conceptual whole.
