## Viva Comments

Literature review
[x] Add a short paragraph covering some of the work from the NIME community on VR/ AR that is not currently included, whilst making clear the reason that related work in VR is not covered in any detail (this could include the work of Florent Berthaut, Stephania Serafin, Cumhur Erkut, or Pieter-Jan Maes) 
[x] Consider citing a recent book that covers a large number of these systems, for example Geronazzo, M., & Serafin, S. (2023). Sonic Interactions in Virtual Environments Springer Nature. 
[x] Check for any important and closely related work published in the last year.

Design methods
[x] Make clear that you used the ABD method, although in a less formal way, for the second two studies as well as the first.
[x] Add a few sentences indicating how the theory cited in Part I influenced your design decisions regarding the three artifacts presented in Part II – either a paragraph in Chapter 4, or a few sentences in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 with a few specific examples of decisions influenced by the theoretical lenses used.

[x] Look again at the text here to remove repetition regarding polaris~ (as identified by you during the viva).

[x] Look again at the opening sentences to this Chapter, and consider softening the claims you make about AR, in line with the critical perspective you have taken throughout the rest of the thesis.

Design patterns
[x] Change “design patterns” to “design guidelines” throughout, in line with discussions in the viva.
