    \noindent This thesis resituates augmented reality (AR) as an artistic medium for the creation of interactive and expressive works by computational artists and musicians. If an AR system can be thought of as one that combines real and virtual processes, is interactive in real-time, and is registered in three dimensions; why do we witness the majority of AR applications utilising primarily visual displays of information? In this practice-based research, I propose a compositional approach to developing sound art using AR (sound ARt), arguing that, as an medium that combines real and virtual multisensory processes, it must explored with a multisensory approach. The paper further outlines the study methods that I will use to evaluate the developed experiences. The contributions of this project are twofold, the development of a set of design patterns for creating sound ARt, as well as AR hardware, software and three sound ARt experiences that have been developed and evaluated.
