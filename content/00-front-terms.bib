    Earlier theses on the matter include Daniel Guerin's 1936 post-WWI analysis of the German and Italian fascist regimes: `Starting from a desire to assure private enterprise maximum freedom, fascism is compelled to gradually bureaucratize the economy and is more and more trapped in the contradiction between what it would like to do and what it must do. Groping tortuously forward, it succeeds in maintaining the capitalist system, but only by restricting each individual capitalist's freedom of movement, and by sacrificing the other branches of the economy on the altar of heavy industry. Only the great capitalists continue to draw their profits, while the economy as a whole is paralysed and individuals of every class are ruined or put on short rations.' \citeyearpar[][p.280]{guerin1936}}
