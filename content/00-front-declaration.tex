\noindent This thesis was typeset with \hologo{LaTeXe} to conform with University of Sussex \href{https://www.sussex.ac.uk/rsao/examination}{guidelines}, using a \href{https://github.com/sambilbow/Sussex_PhDThesis}{modified version} of \href{https://github.com/Martin-Jung/Sussex_PhDThesis}{Martin Jung's} and \href{https://github.com/fabriziomiano/phd_thesis}{Fabrizio Milano's} templates. It was compiled with \hologo{pdfLaTeX}, and references were exported from \verb|Zotero| and typeset with \hologo{BibTeX}. The terms list is implemented with \verb|bib2gls| and \verb|glossaries-extra|.

\noindent This version of the thesis is best read and / or annotated using a PDF viewer (maybe one day in AR!). It makes heavy use of hyperlinks, hence the reader may benefit from using a viewer that has navigation history, i.e., backwards \faArrowCircleLeft\space, and forwards \faArrowCircleRight\space buttons. This will greatly help in getting back to text after checking references in the bibliography or definitions in the terms list. Free / libre open-source PDF viewers with this functionality include \href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/skim-app/}{Skim} \faApple\space \footnote{View $\blacktriangleright$ Customize Toolbar $\blacktriangleright$ add `Back/Forward'}, \href{https://okular.kde.org/en-gb/}{Okular} \faLinux \space \faWindows \space \footnote{Settings $\blacktriangleright$ Configure Toolbars  $\blacktriangleright$ Main Toolbar $\blacktriangleright$ Available Actions $\blacktriangleright$ Back in the Document}, and \href{https://sioyek.info/}{Sioyek} \faApple \space \faLinux \space \faWindows \space \footnote{Keyboard $\blacktriangleright$ Backspace / Shift-Backspace}. These three PDF viewers also allow previewing of links within the thesis, meaning you can glance at references and term definitions without leaving the page.

\noindent Preview \faApple\space \footnote{View $\blacktriangleright$ Customize Toolbar $\blacktriangleright$ add `Page History'} and Adobe Acrobat \faApple\space \faLinux \space \faWindows \space \footnote{View $\blacktriangleright$  Show/Hide $\blacktriangleright$ Toolbar Items $\blacktriangleright$ Show Page Navigation Tools $\blacktriangleright$ Show All Page Navigation Tools} also feature page navigation, but unfortunately not link previews. All PDF viewers mentioned also feature sidebar contents tables, which this thesis uses comprehensively for ease of reader navigation.

\noindent The hyperlinks in this thesis have been colour coded to ensure that the reader knows where they link to. Colours have been chosen for their legibility on both light and dark backgrounds, taking into consideration readers who may have deuteranopia (red-green) colour vision deficiency by prioritising link colour-contrast difference \footnote{Using advice from \href{https://colorbrewer2.org/\#type=qualitative\&scheme=Dark2}{ColorBrewer 2.0}}.

\noindent\textcolor{Hyurlcolor}{Purple} hyperlinks direct the reader out of the thesis, to a website

\noindent\textcolor{Hylinkcolor}{Orange} hyperlinks direct the reader to another page in the thesis

\noindent\textcolor{Hycitecolor}{Green} hyperlinks direct the reader to a reference in the bibliography

\vspace*{0.25cm}
\noindent Additionally, terms that occur frequently within the thesis are defined in the \hyperref[main]{Working Definitions} section. Specifically abbreviated terms are, on first use, prefixed by their `long' name, and marked with a \textcolor{Hylinkcolor}{$\circlearrowleft$} symbol. From then on, the reader may click on the abbreviated term as it comes up throughout the thesis to navigate to its definition entry. These subsequent uses of the term won't be coloured or decorated so as not to distract the reader, but like \hyperref[sec: reading]{orange} hyperlinks they are navigable via click (mouse) or tap (touch screen); and previewable via hover in Skim and Okular, or right-click in Sioyek.
