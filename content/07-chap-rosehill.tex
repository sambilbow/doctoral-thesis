\section{Developing an AR Performance Practice} \label{sec: performance-developing}
As a direct consequence of witnessing participants enjoyment and play with polaris\textasciitilde{}, I recognised for the first time looking from the outside in, that the system had a larger propensity for fostering learning, virtuosity, and depth of expression than I had originally thought; if only the experience was slightly more complex, the interactions more \textit{nuanced}. The gestures, play, and expression by participants led to a kind of quasi-transhumanist dance, one that struck me as a technologically mediated dialogue between hybrid self and hybrid environment, a delicate balance of agency.

Until this point, I had been primarily focused on the medium as used for the composition of musical pieces e.g. \hyperref[sec: area]{area\textasciitilde{}}, or of installation-like experiences \hyperref[sec: polaris]{polaris\textasciitilde{}}. Performance with AR had remained abstract, especially as, formally, its not my preferred mode of musical expression. However, the balance of agency between participant and system, between self and environment, presented itself during the evaluation of polaris\textasciitilde{} to be an area ready for exploration through performance.

A lot of the infrastructure I had used in the development of polaris\textasciitilde{} was readily transferable to the context of performance. There was no need to change from the combination of PureData, LibPdIntegration, and Unity.

However, there were new considerations, my experience would need to somehow be shared with an audience, so what role would my interactions have

\textit{Weird Polygons and Hand Noises} is the name given to the set of AR instruments I first performed live.
