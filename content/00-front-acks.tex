I cannot express enough how much gratitude I feel for my partner and fianc√©e Hanna for the amount of support she has so lovingly provided me over the last few years. You have made the tough days easier, and the fun days memorable, I simply couldn't have done it without you. I would also like to thank my friends for encouraging me to take on this journey and have provided more support than they know, especially Dan, Glory, Lauren and Joe; and to those I've met along the way and have provided helpful ears, Fiona, Yaz, Colin, Katherine and Chris. Thanks too to my family, close and extended.
