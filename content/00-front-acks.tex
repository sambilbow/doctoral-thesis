The world, both its real and virtual counterparts, seem to be making such tectonic shifts at the moment. Since beginning this my academic journey eight years ago, numerous wars have threatened what felt already felt like tentative stability. There have been five conservative prime ministers here in the UK, and any chance of reasonable discussion or policy around the most pressing matters facing the lives of people around the world -- especially those who are most effected -- has been all but absent. COVID-19 has only made it more painfully obvious that business-as-usual is not an option if we want a brighter and fairer future; global mega-corp supply-chains are too hegemonic and thus fragile, Western health and too naïve, its climate policy purposefully vague, and our mistreatment of nature and animals too brutal. Last week, our conservative government green-lit a new coal mine in Cumbria. 

In the digital world, if it can at all be meaningfully separated from its physical counterpart any more, the last eight years has been equally tumultuous. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal, to the rise of bot-farms threatening online and offline misinformation; the fact that more and more, our understanding about the world and the people around us is mediated by technology delivered by mega-corporations, means that in turn behaviour is opened up to the wishes of those with the capital to access it. 

I cannot express enough how much gratitude I feel for my partner and fiancée Hanna for the amount of support she has so lovingly provided me over the last few years. You have made the tough days bearable, and the fun days memorable, I simply couldn't have done it without you. I would also like to thank my friends for encouraging me to take on this journey and providing me with more support than I think they know, especially Dan, Glory, Lauren, Joe, Dash, Chan, Ezda, Nik, and Harry; and to those I've met along the way and have provided helpful ears, Fiona, Yaz, Colin, Katherine and Chris. Special thanks too to my family, close and extended who have provided me with motivation in times when I lacked the ability to conjure up my own.
